	No priorities, againâ€¦?! Please don't do this to meâ€¦ ðŸ˜•
</p><p>
	Well, let's not continue with TH05 then ðŸ˜› And instead use the occasion to
	commit <a href="https://twitter.com/m1yur1/status/1018855232371998720">this
	interesting discovery, made by @m1yur1 last year</a>. Yup, TH03's "ZUNSP"
	sprite driver is actually a "rebranded" version of Promisence Soft's
	<code>SPRITE16.COM</code>. Sure, you <i>were</i> allowed to use this
	driver in your own game, but replacing the copyright with your own isn't
	exactly the nicest thing to doâ€¦ That now makes three library programmers
	that ZUN didn't credit. Makes me wonder what makes M. Kajihara so special.
	Probably the fact that Touhou has always been about the music for ZUN,
	first and foremost.
</p><p>
	But what makes this more than a piece of trivia is the fact that
	Promiscence Soft's SPRITE16 sample game <i>StormySpace</i> was bundled
	with documentation on the driver. Shoutout to the Neo Kobe PC-98
	collection for preserving he original release!
</p><p>
	That means more documented third-party code that we don't necessarily have
	to reverse-engineer, just like master.lib or KAJA's PMD driver. However,
	the PC-98 EGC <i>is</i> rather complex and <i>definitely</i> not designed
	for alpha-tested 16-color sprite blitting. So it (once again) took quite a
	while to make sense of SPRITE16's code and the available documentation on
	the EGC, to come up with satisfying function names. As a result, I'm going
	to distribute the entire RE work related to TH03's SPRITE16 interface
	across a total of three pushes, this one being the first of them.
</p><ul>
	<li>The second one will reverse-engineer the SPRITE16 code reachable from
	its interrupt handler, and also come with somewhat detailed English
	documentation on the PC-98 EGC raster ops in particular,</li>
	<li>and the third one will cover TH03's sprite drawing functions, which
	look pretty undecompilable once againâ€¦</li>
</ul><p>
	Next up, we do have more TH05 progress though, now for the first time
	specifically with position independence in mind. Pretty excited for this
	one!
