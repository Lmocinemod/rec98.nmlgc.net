	Technical debt, part 10… in which two of the PMD-related functions came
	with such complex ramifications that they required one full push after
	all, leaving no room for the additional decompilations I wanted to do. At
	least, this <i>did</i> end up being the final one, completing all
	<code>SHARED</code> segments for the time being.
</p><hr /><p>
	The first one of these functions determines the BGM and sound effect
	modes, combining the resident type of the PMD driver with the Option menu
	setting. The TH04 and TH05 version is apparently coded quite smartly, as
	PC-98 Touhou only needs to distinguish <i>"OPN-&nbsp;/
	PC-9801-26K-compatible sound sources handled by <code>PMD.COM</code>"</i>
	from <i>"everything else"</i>, since all other PMD varieties are
	OPNA-&nbsp;/ PC-9801-86-compatible.<br />
	Therefore, I only documented those two results returned from PMD's
	<code>AH=09h</code> function. I'll leave a comprehensive, fully documented
	enum to interested contributors, since that would involve research into
	basically the entire history of the PC-9800 series, and even the clearly
	out-of-scope PC-88VA. After all, distinguishing between more versions of
	the PMD driver in the Option menu (and adding new sprites for them!) is
	strictly mod territory.
</p><hr /><p>
	The honor of being the final decompiled function in any <code>SHARED</code>
	segment went to TH04's <code>snd_load()</code>. TH04 contains by far the
	sanest version of this function: Readable C code, no new ZUN bugs (and
	still missing file I/O error handling, of course)… but wait, what about
	that actual file read syscall, using the <code>INT 21h, AH=3Fh</code> DOS
	file read API? Reading up to a hardcoded number of bytes into PMD's or
	MMD's song or sound effect buffer, 20&nbsp;KiB in TH02-TH04, 64&nbsp;KiB in
	TH05… that's kind of weird. About time we looked closer into this.
	{{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
</p><p>
	Turns out that no, KAJA's driver doesn't give you the full 64 KiB of one
	memory segment for these, as especially TH05's code might suggest to
	anyone  unfamiliar with these drivers. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Instead,
	you can customize the size of these buffers on its command line. In
	<code>GAME.BAT</code>, ZUN allocates 8 KiB for FM songs, 2 KiB for sound
	effects, and 12 KiB for MMD files in TH02… which means that the hardcoded
	sizes in <code>snd_load()</code> are completely wrong, no matter how you
	look at them. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Consequently, this read syscall
	<i>will</i> overflow PMD's or MMD's song or sound effect buffer if the
	given file is larger than the respective buffer size.<br />
	Now, ZUN could have simply hardcoded the sizes from <code>GAME.BAT</code>
	instead, and it would have been fine. As it <i>also</i> turns out though,
	PMD has an API function (<code>AH=22h</code>) to retrieve the actual
	buffer sizes, provided for exactly that purpose. There is little excuse
	not to use it, as it also gives you PMD's default sizes if you don't
	specify any yourself.<br />
	(Unless your build process enumerates all PMD files that are part of the
	game, and bakes the largest size into both <code>snd_load()</code> and
	<code>GAME.BAT</code>. That would even work with MMD, which doesn't have
	an equivalent for <code>AH=22h</code>.)
</p><p>
	What'd be the consequence of loading a larger file then? Well, since we
	don't get a full segment, let's look at the theoretical limit first.<br />
	PMD prefers to keep both its driver code and the data buffers in a single
	memory segment. As a result, the limit for the combined size of the song,
	instrument, and sound effect buffer is determined by the amount of
	<i>code</i> in the driver itself. In PMD86 version 4.8o (bundled with TH04
	and TH05) for example, the remaining size for these buffers is exactly
	45,555 bytes. Being an actually good programmer who doesn't blindly trust
	user input, KAJA thankfully validates the sizes given via the
	<kbd>/M</kbd>, <kbd>/V</kbd>, and <kbd>/E</kbd> command-line options
	before letting the driver reside in memory, and shuts down with an error
	message if they exceed 40 KiB. Would have been even better if he calculated
	the exact size – even in the current
	<a href="http://www5.airnet.ne.jp/kajapon/tool.html">PMD version 4.8s from
	January 2020</a>, it's still a hardcoded value (see line 8581).<br />
	Either way: If the file is larger than this maximum, the concrete effect
	is down to the <code>INT 21h, AH=3Fh</code> implementation in the
	underlying DOS version. DOS 3.3 treats the destination address as linear
	and reads past the end of the segment,
	<a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/blob/e38fde9d2938ca7b169cdd5376d95b66091709fe/src/dos/dos.cpp#L1607">DOS
	5.0 and DOSBox-X truncate the number of bytes to not exceed the remaining
	space in the segment</a>, and maybe there's even a DOS that wraps around
	and ends up overwriting the PMD driver code. In any case: You <i>will</i>
	overwrite what's after the driver in memory – typically, the game .EXE and
	its master.lib functions.
</p><p>
	It almost feels like a happy accident that this doesn't cause issues in
	the original games. The largest PMD file in any of the 4 games, the -86
	version of <i lang="ja">幽夢　～ Inanimate Dream</i>, takes up 8,099 bytes,
	just under the 8,192 byte limit for BGM. For modders, I'd really recommend
	implementing this properly, with PMD's <code>AH=22h</code> function and
	error handling, once position independence has been reached.
</p><p>
	Whew, didn't think I'd be doing more research into KAJA's drivers during
	regular ReC98 development! That's probably been the final time though, as
	all involved functions are now decompiled, and I'm unlikely to iterate
	over them again.
</p><hr /><p>
	And that's it! Repaid the biggest chunk of technical debt, time for some
	actual progress again. Next up: Reopening the store tomorrow, and waiting
	for new priorities. If we got nothing by Sunday, I'm going to put the
	pending {{DB_CustomerByID 0}} pushes towards some work on the website.
