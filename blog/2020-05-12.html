	Back to TH01, and its high score menu… oh, wait, that one will eventually
	involve keyboard input. And thanks to the generous TH01 funding situation,
	there's really no reason <i>not</i> to cover that right now. After all,
	TH01 is the last game where input still hadn't been RE'd.<br />
	But first, let's also cover that one unused blitting function, together
	with <code>REIIDEN.CFG</code> loading and saving, which are in front of
	the input function in <code>OP.EXE</code>… (By now, we all know about
	<a href="https://tcrf.net/Touhou_Reiiden:_The_Highly_Responsive_to_Prayers#Bomb_Option">
	the hidden start bomb configuration</a>, right?)
</p><p>
	Unsurprisingly, the earliest game also implements input in the messiest
	way, with a different function for each of the three executables. "Because
	they all react differently to keyboard inputs {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}",
	apparently? <code>OP.EXE</code> even has two functions for it, one for the
	<span style="color: #993399;">START / CONTINUE / OPTION / QUIT</span> main
	menu, and one for both Option and Music Test menus, both of which directly
	perform the ring arithmetic on the menu cursor variable. A consistent
	separation of keyboard polling from input processing apparently wasn't all
	too obvious of a thought, since it's only truly done from TH02 on.
</p><p>
	This lack of proper architecture becomes actually hilarious once you
	notice that it did in fact facilitate a recursion bug!

	<a href="https://tcrf.net/Touhou_Reiiden:_The_Highly_Responsive_to_Prayers#Debug_Features">
	In case you've been living under a rock for the past 8 years, TH01 shipped
	with debugging features, which you can enter by running the game via
	<code>game d</code> from the DOS prompt.</a> These features include a
	memory info screen, shown when pressing PgUp, implemented as one blocking
	function (<code>test_mem()</code>) called directly in response to the
	pressed key inside the polling function. <code>test_mem()</code> only
	returns once that screen is left by pressing PgDown. And in order to poll
	input… it directly calls back into the same polling function that called
	it in the first place, after a 3-frame delay.
</p><p>
	Which means that <i>this screen is actually re-entered for every 3 frames
	that the PgUp key is being held</i>. And yes, you can, of course, also
	crash the system via a stack overflow this way by holding down PgUp for a
	few seconds, if that's your thing.<br />
	<strong>Edit (2020-09-17):</strong> Here's a video from
	<a href="https://twitter.com/spaztron64">spaztron64</a>, showing off this
	exact stack overflow crash while running under the
	<a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/hardware/se025675.html">VEM486
	memory manager</a>, which displays additional information about these
	sorts of crashes:

</p><p>
	What makes this even funnier is that the code actually tracks the last
	state of every polled key, to prevent exactly that sort of bug. But the
	copy-pasted assignment of the last input state is only done <i>after</i>
	<code>test_mem()</code> already returned, making it effectively pointless
	for PgUp. It <i>does</i> work as intended for PgDown… and that's why you
	have to actually press <i>and release</i> this key once for every call to
	<code>test_mem()</code> in order to actually get back into the game. Even
	though a single call to PgDown will already <i>show</i> the game screen
	again.
</p><p>
	In maybe more relevant news though, this function also came with what can
	be considered the first piece of actual gameplay logic! Bombing via
	double-tapping the Z and X keys is also handled here, and now we know that
	both keys simply have to be tapped twice within a window of 20 frames.
	They are tracked independently from each other, so you don't necessarily
	have to press them simultaneously.<br />
	In debug mode, the <code>bomb</code> count tracks precisely this window of
	time. That's why it only resets back to 0 when pressing Z or X if it's
	≥20.
</p><p>
	Sure, TH01's code is expectedly terrible and messy. But compared to the
	micro-optimizations of TH04 and TH05, it's an absolute joy to work on, and
	opening all these ZUN bug loot boxes is just the icing on the cake.
	Looking forward to more of the high score menu in the next pushes!
