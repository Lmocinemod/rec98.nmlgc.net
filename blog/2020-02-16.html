	Long time no see! And this is exactly why I've been procrastinating
	bullets while there was still meaningful progress to be had in other parts
	of TH04 and TH05: There was bound to be quite some complexity in this most
	central piece of game logic, and so I couldn't possibly get to a
	satisfying understanding in just one push.
</p><p>
	Or in two, because their rendering involves another bunch of
	micro-optimized functions adapted from master.lib.
</p><p>
	Or in three, because we'd like to actually name all the bullet sprites,
	since there are a number of sprite ID-related conditional branches. And
	so, I was refining things I supposedly RE'd in the the commits from the
	first push until the very end of the fourth.
</p><p>
	When we talk about "bullets" in TH04 and TH05, we mean just two things:
	the white 8Ã—8 pellets, with a cap of 240 in TH04 and 180 in TH05, and any
	16Ã—16 sprites from <code>MIKO16.BFT</code>, with a cap of 200 in TH04 and
	220 in TH05. These are by far the most common types ofâ€¦ err, "things the
	player can collide with", and so ZUN provides a whole bunch of pre-made
	motion, animation, and <a href="https://sparen.github.io/ph3tutorials/ddsga3.html">
	n-way spread / ring / stack</a> pattern options for those, which can be
	selected by simply setting a few fields in the bullet template. All the
	other "non-bullets" have to be fired and controlled individually.
</p><p>
	Which is nothing new, since uth05win covered this part pretty accurately â€“
	I don't think <i>anyone</i> could just make up these structure member
	overloads. The interesting insights here all come from applying this
	research to TH04, and figuring out its differences compared to TH05. The
	most notable one there is in the default patterns: TH05 allows you to add
	a <a href="https://sparen.github.io/ph3tutorials/ddsga3.html#sub5">stack</a>
	to any single bullet, n-way spread or ring, but TH04 only lets you create
	stacks separately from n-way spreads and rings, and thus gets by with
	fewer fields in its bullet template structure. On the other hand, TH04 has
	a separate "n-way spread with random angles, yet still aimed at the
	player" pattern? Which <i>seems</i> to be unused, at least as far as
	midbosses and bosses are concerned; can't say anything about stage enemies
	yet.
</p><p>
	In fact, TH05's larger bullet template structure illustrates that these
	distinct pattern types actually are a rather redundant piece of
	over-engineering. You can perfectly indicate any permutation of the basic
	patterns through just the stack bullet count (1 = no stack), spread bullet
	count (1 = no spread), and spread delta angle (0 = ring instead of
	spread). Add a 4-flag bitfield to cover the rest (aim to player, randomize
	angle, randomize speed, force single bullet regardless of difficulty or
	rank), and the result would be less redundant <i>and</i> even slightly
	more capable.
</p><p>
	Even those 4 pushes didn't quite finish all of the bullet-related types,
	stopping just shy of the most trivial and consistent enum that defines
	special movement. This also left us in a
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-01-29" "TH03-like situation"}}, in which we're still
	a bit away from actually converting all this research into actual RE%. Oh
	well, at least this got us way past 50% in overall position independence.
	On to the second half! ðŸŽ‰
</p><p>
	For the next push though, we'll first have a quick detour to the remaining
	C code of all the <code>ZUN.COM</code> binaries. Now that the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-01-03" "TH04 and TH05 resident structures"}} no
	longer block those, {{DB_CustomerByID 2}} has requested TH05's
	<code>RES_KSO.COM</code> to be covered in one of his outstanding pushes.
	And since <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UChyVpooBi31k3xPbWYsoq3w">32th System</a>
	recently RE'd TH03's resident structure, it makes sense to also review and
	merge that, before decompiling all three remaining <code>RES_*.COM</code>
	binaries in hopefully a single push. It might even get done faster than
	that, in which case I'll then review and merge some more of
	<a href="https://github.com/wintiger0222/ReC98">WindowsTiger</a>'s
	research.
