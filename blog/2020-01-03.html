	A~nd <a href="/faq#three">resident structures</a> ended up being exactly
	the right thing to start off the new year with.
	<a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsTiger">WindowsTiger</a> and
	<a href="https://twitter.com/spaztron64">spaztron64</a> have already been
	pushing for them with their own reverse-engineering, and together with my
	own recent <tt>GENSOU.SCR</tt> RE work, we've clarified just enough
	context around the harder-to-explain values to make both TH04's and TH05's
	structures fit nicely into the typical time frame of a single push.
</p><p>
	With all the apparently obvious and seemingly just duplicated values, it
	has always been easy to do a superficial job for most of the structure,
	then lose motivation for the last few unknown fields. Pretty glad to got
	this finally covered; I've heard that people are going to write trainer
	tools now?
</p><p>
	Also, where better to slot in a push that, in terms of figures, seems to
	deliver 0% RE and only miniscule PI progress, than at the end of
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}}'s 5-push order that already had multiple pushes
	yielding above-average progress? {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} As usual,
	we'll be reaping the rewards of this work in the next few TH04/TH05
	pushes…
</p><p>
	…whenever they get funded, that is, as for January, the backers have
	shifted the priorities towards TH01 and TH03. TH01 especially is something
	I'm quite excited about, as we're finally going to see just how fast this
	bloated game is really going to progress. Are you excited?
