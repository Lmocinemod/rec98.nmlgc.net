<p>Turns out I had only been about half done with the drawing routines. The rest was all related to redrawing the scrolling stage backgrounds after other sprites were drawn on top. Since the PC-98 does have hardware-accelerated scrolling, but no hardware-accelerated sprites, everything that draws animated sprites into a scrolling VRAM must then also make sure that the background tiles covered by the sprite are redrawn in the next frame, which required a bit of ZUN code. And <i>that</i> are the functions that have been in the way of the expected rapid reverse-engineering progress that uth05win was supposed to bring. So, looks like everything's going to go really fast now?</p>
