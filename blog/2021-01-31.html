	Wow, 31 commits in a single push? Well, what the last push had in
	progress, this one had in maintenance. The
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-03" "master.lib header transition"}} absolutely
	<i>had</i> to be completed in this one, for my own sanity. And indeed,
	it reduced the build time for the entirety of ReC98 to about 27 seconds on
	my system, just as expected in the original announcement. Looking forward
	to even faster build times with the upcoming <code>#include</code>
	improvements I've got up my sleeve! The port authors of the future are
	going to appreciate those quite a bit.

	As for the new translation units, the funniest one is probably TH05's
	function for blitting the 1-color .CDG images used for the main menu
	options. Which is <i>so</i> optimized that it becomes decompilable again,
	by ditching the self-modifying code of its TH04 counterpart in favor of
	simply making better use of CPU registers. The resulting C code is still a
	mess, but what can you do. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
	This was followed by even more TH05 functions that clearly weren't
	compiled from C, as evidenced by their <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/1d5db7155aa31467c9256f58112420f079078f81/Research/Borland%20C%2B%2B%20decompilation.md#padding-bytes-in-code-segments">padding
	bytes</a>. It's about time I've documented my lack of ideas of how to get
	those out of Turbo C++. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	And just like in the previous push, I also had to {{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-16" "throw away"}} a decompiled TH02 function purely due to alignment issues. Couldn't have been a better one though, no one's going to miss a residency check for the MMD driver that is largely identical to the corresponding (and indeed decompilable) function for the PMD driver. Both of those should have been merged into a single function anyway, given how they also mutate the game's sound configuration flags…
</p><p>
	In the end, I've slightly slowed down with this one, with <i>only</i> 37% of technical debt done after this 4th dedicated push. Next up: One more of these, centered around TH05's stupidly optimized .PI functions. Maybe also with some more reverse-engineering, after not having done any for 1½ months?
