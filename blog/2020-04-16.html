	Alright, the score popup numbers shown when collecting items or defeating
	(mid)bosses. The second-to-last remaining big entity type in TH05… with
	quite some PI false positives in the memory range occupied by its data.
	Good thing I still got some outstanding generic RE pushes that haven't
	been claimed for anything more specific in over a month! These
	conveniently allowed me to RE most of these functions right away, the
	right way.
</p><p>
	Most of the false positives were boss HP values, passed to a "boss phase
	end" function which sets the HP value at which the next phase should end.
	Stage 6 Yuuka, Mugetsu, and EX-Alice have their own copies of this
	function, in which they also reset certain boss-specific global variables.
	Since I always like to cover all varieties of such duplicated functions at
	once, it made sense to reverse-engineer all the involved variables while I
	was at it… and that's why this was exactly the right time to cover the
	implementation details of Stage 6 Yuuka's parasol and vanishing animations
	in TH04. {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}
</p><p>
	With still a bit of time left in that RE push afterwards, I could also
	start looking into some of the smaller functions that didn't quite fit
	into other pushes. The most notable one there was a simple function that
	aims from any point to the current player position. Which actually only
	became a separate function in TH05, probably since it's called 27 times in
	total. That's 27 places no longer being blocked from further RE progress.
</p><p>
	<a href="https://github.com/wintiger0222/ReC98">WindowsTiger</a> already
	did most of the work for the score popup numbers in January, which meant
	that I only had to review it and bring it up to ReC98's current coding
	styles and standards. This one turned out to be one of those rare features
	whose TH05 implementation is significantly <i>less</i> insane than the
	TH04 one. Both games lazily redraw only the tiles of the stage background
	that were drawn over in the previous frame, and try their best to minimize
	the amount of tiles to be redrawn in this way. For these popup numbers,
	this involves calculating the on-screen width, based on the exact number
	of digits in the point value. TH04 calculates this width every frame
	during the rendering function, and even resorts to setting that field
	through the digit iteration pointer via self-modifying code… yup. TH05, on
	the other hand, simply calculates the width once when spawning a new popup
	number, during the conversion of the point value to
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary-coded
	decimal</a>. The "×2" multiplier suffix being removed in TH05 certainly
	also helped in simplifying that feature in this game.
</p><p>
	And that's ⅓ of TH05 reverse-engineered! Next up, one more TH05 PI push,
	in which the stage enemies hopefully finish all the big entity types.
	Maybe it will also be accompanied by another RE push? In any case, that
	will be the last piece of TH05 progress for quite some time. The next TH01
	stretch will consist of 6 pushes at the very least, and I currently have
	no idea of how much time I can spend on ReC98 a month from now…
