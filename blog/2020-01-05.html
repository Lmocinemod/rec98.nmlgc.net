	So, the thing that made me so excited about TH01 were all those bulky C
	reimplementations of master.lib functions. Identical copies in all three
	executables, trivial to figure out and decompile, removing tons of
	instructions, and providing a foundation for large parts of the game
	later. The first set of functions near the end of that shared code segment
	deals with color palette handling, and master.lib's resident palette
	structure in particular. (No relation to <a href="/faq#three">the game's
	resident structure.</a>) Which directly starts us out with pretty much
	<i>all</i> the decompilation difficulties imaginable:
</p><ul>
	<li>iteration over internal DOS structures via segment pointers – Turbo
	C++ doesn't support a lot of arithmetic on those, requiring tons of casts
	to make it work</li>
	<li>calls to a <code>far</code> function near the beginning of a segment
	from a function near the end of a segment – these are undecompilable until
	we've decompiled both functions (and thus, the majority of the segment),
	and need to be spelled out in ASM for the time being. And if the caller
	<i>then</i> stores some of the involved variables in registers, there's no
	way around the ugliest of workarounds, <i>spelling out opcode bytes</i>…
	</li>
	<li>surprising color format inconsistencies – apparently, GRB (rather than
	RGB) is some sort of wider standard in PC-98 inter-process communication,
	because it matches the order of the hardware's palette register ports?
	(<span style="color: green;"><code>0AAh</code> = green</span>,
	<span style="color: red;"><code>0ACh</code> = red</span>,
	<span style="color: blue;"><code>0AEh</code> = blue</span>)? Yet the
	game's actual palette still uses RGB…</li>
</ul><p>
	And as it turns out, the game doesn't even use the resident palette
	feature. Which adds yet another set of functions to the, uh, learning
	experience that ZUN must have chosen this game to be. I wouldn't be
	surprised if we manage to uncover actual scrapped beta game content later
	on, among all the unused code that's bound to still be in there.

	At least decompilation should get easier for the next few TH01 pushes now…
	right?
