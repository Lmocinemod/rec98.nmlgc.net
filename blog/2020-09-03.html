	(tl;dr: ReC98 has switched to <a href="http://gittup.org/tup">Tup</a> for
	the 32-bit build. You probably want to get <a href="{{$tup}}"><strong>
	ðŸ’¾&nbsp;this build of Tup</strong></a>, and put it somewhere in your
	<code>PATH</code>. It's optional, and always will be, but highly
	recommended.)
</p><hr /><p>
	P0001! Reserved for the delivery of the very first financial contribution
	I've ever received for ReC98, back in January 2018. {{DB_CustomerByID 1}}
	requested the exact opposite of immediate results, which motivated me to
	go on quite a passionate quest for the perfect ReC98 build system. A quest
	that went way beyond the crowdfundingâ€¦
</p><p>
	Makefiles are a decent idea in theory: Specify the targets to generate,
	the source files these targets depend on and are generated from, and the
	rules to do the generating, with some helpful shorthand syntax. Then, you
	have a build dependency graph, and your <code>make</code> tool of choice
	can provide minimal rebuilds of only the targets whose sources changed
	since the last <code>make</code> call. But, uhâ€¦ wait, this is C/C++ we're
	talking about, and doesn't pretty much every source file come with a
	second set of dependent source files, namely, <i>every single
	<code>#include</code> in the source file itself</i>? Do we <i>really</i>
	have to duplicate all these inside the Makefile, and keep it in sync with the source file? ðŸ™„
</p><p>
	This fact alone means that Makefiles are inherently unsuited for
	<i>any</i> language with an <code>#include</code> featureâ€¦ that is, pretty
	much every language out there. Not to mention other aspects like changes
	to the compilation command lines, or the build rules themselves, all of
	which require metadata of the previous build to be persistently stored in
	some way. I have no idea why such a trash technology is even touted as a
	viable build tool for code.
</p><p>
	But wait! Most <code>make</code> implementations, including Borland's, do
	support the notion of <i>auto-dependency</i> information, emitted by the
	compiler in a specific format, to provide <code>make</code> with the
	additional list of <code>#include</code>s. Sure, this should be a basic
	feature of any self-respecting build tool, and not something you have to
	<i>add</i> as an <i>extension</i>, but let's just set our idealism aside
	for a moment. Well, too bad that Borland's implementation
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReCBMake">only works if you spell out
	both the <i>sourceâžœobject</i> and the <i>objectâžœbinary</i> rules, which
	loses the performance gained from compiling multiple translation units in
	a single <code>BCC</code> or <code>TCC</code> process. And even then, it
	tends to break in that DOS VM you're probably using.</a> Not to mention,
	<i>again</i>, all the other aspects that still remain unsolved.
</p><p>
	So, I decided to just
	<a href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1162488931365113859">
	write my own build system</a>, tailor-made for the needs of ReC98's 16-bit
	build process, and combining a number of experimental ideas. Which is
	<i>still</i> not quite bug-free and ready for public use, given that the
	entire past year has kept me busy with actual tangible RE and PI progress.
	What <i>did</i> finally become ready, however, is the improvement for the
	32-bit build part, and that's what we've got here.
</p><hr /><p>
	ðŸ’­ Now, if only there was a build system that would perfectly track
	dependencies of <i>any</i> compiler it calls, by injecting code and
	hooking file opening syscalls. It'd be completely unrealistic for it to
	also run on DOS (and we probably don't want to traverse a graph database
	in a cycle-limited DOSBox), but it would be perfect for our 32-bit build
	part, as long as that one still exists.
</p><p>
	Turns out <a href="http://gittup.org/tup/">Tup</a> is exactly that system.
	In practice, its low-level nature as a <code>make</code> replacement does
	limit its general usefulness, which is why you probably haven't seen it
	used in a lot of projects. But for something like ReC98 with its reliance
	on outdated compilers that aren't supported by any decent high-level tool,
	it's exactly the right tool for the job. Also, it's completely beyond me
	how <a href="https://ninja-build.org/manual.html#ref_headers">Ninja, the
	most popular <code>make</code> replacement these days, was inspired by
	Tup, yet went a step back to parsing the specific dependency information
	produced by gcc, Clang, and Visual Studio, and <i>only</i> those</a>â€¦
</p><p>
	Sure, it might seem <i>really</i> minor to worry about not unconditionally
	rebuilding all 32-bit <code>.asm</code> files, which just takes a couple
	of seconds anyway. But minimal rebuilds in the 32-bit part also provide
	the foundation for minimal rebuilds in the 16-bit part â€“ and those
	<code>TLINK</code> invocations <i>do</i> take quite some time after all.
</p><p>
	Using Tup for ReC98 was an idea that dated back to January 2017. Back
	then, I already opened <a href="https://github.com/gittup/tup/pull/308">
	the pull request with a fix to allow Tup to work together with 32-bit
	TASM</a>. As much as I love Tup though, the fact that it only worked on
	64-bit Windows â‰¥Vista would have meant that we had to exchange perfect
	dependency tracking for the ability to build on 32-bit and older Windows
	versions <i>at all</i>. For a project that relies on DOS compilers, this
	would have been exactly the wrong trade-off to make.
</p><p>
	What's worse though: <code>TLINK</code> fails to run on modern 32-bit
	Windows with <code>Loader error (0000) : Unrecognized Error</code>.
	Therefore, the set of systems that Tup runs on, and the set of systems
	that can actually compile ReC98's 16-bit build part natively, would have
	been exactly disjoint, with no OS getting to use both at the same time.
	<br />
	So I've kept using Tup for only my own development, but indefinitely
	shelved the idea of making it the official build system, due to those
	drawbacks. Recently though, it all came together:
	<ul>
		<li>The <code>tup generate</code> sub-command can generate a
		<code>.bat</code> file that does a full dumb rebuild of everything,
		which can serve as a fallback option for systems that can't run Tup.
		All we have to do is to commit that <code>.bat</code> file to the
		ReC98 Git repository as well, and tell <code>build32b.bat</code> to
		fall back on that if Tup can't be run. That alone would have given us
		the benefits of Tup without being worse than the current dumb build
		process.</li>
		<li>In the meantime, other contributors improved Tup's own build
		process to the point where 32-bit builds were simple enough to
		accomplish from the comfort of a WSL terminal.</li>
		<li><a href="https://github.com/gittup/tup/pull/406">Two commits of
		mine later</a>, and 32-bit Windows Tup was fully functional. Another
		one later, and 32-bit Windows Tup even gained one potential advantage
		over its 64-bit counterpart. Since it only has to support DLL
		injection into 32-bit programs, it doesn't need a separate 32-bit
		binary for retrieving function pointers to the 32-bit version of
		Windows' DLL loading syscalls. Weirdly enough, Windows Defender on
		current Windows 10 falsely flags that binary as malware, despite it
		doing <i>nothing but printing those pointer values to stdout</i>.
		ðŸ¤·</li>
		<li>And that <code>TLINK</code> bug?
		<a href="http://oshow.txt-nifty.com/blog/2008/11/loader-error-00.html">Easily
		solved by a Google search</a>, and by editing
		<code>%WINDIR%\System32\autoexec.nt</code> and rebooting afterwards:
		<pre class="chroma"> REM Install DPMI support
<span class="gd">-LH %SystemRoot%\system32\dosx
</span><span class="gi">+%SystemRoot%\system32\dosx</span></pre>
		</li>
	</ul>
</p><p>
	As I'm writing this post, the pull request has unfortunately not yet been
	merged. So, here's my own custom build instead:
</p><p>
	<a href="{{$tup}}"><strong>ðŸ’¾ Download Tup for 32-bit Windows</strong></a>
	<small>(optimized build at
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/tup/commit/bac02a5178f6f8edac4ec3bce4d46825785f9f21">this
	commit</a>)</small>
</p><p>
	I've also added it to the DevKit, for any newcomers to ReC98.
</p><hr /><p>
	After the switch to Tup and the fallback option, I extensively tested
	building ReC98 on all operating systems I had lying around. And holy cow,
	so much in that build was broken beyond belief. In the end, the solution
	involved just fully rebuilding the entire 16-bit part by default.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} Which, of course, nullifies any of the
	advantages we might have gotten from a Makefile in the first place, due to
	just how unreliable they are. If you had problems building ReC98 in the
	past, try again now!
</p><p>
	And sure, it would certainly be possible to also get Tup working on
	Windows â‰¤XP, or 9x even. But I leave that to all those tinkerers out there
	who are actually motivated to keep those OSes alive. My work here is
	done&nbsp;â€“&nbsp;we now have a build process that is optimal on 32-bit
	Windows â‰§Vista, and still functional <i>and</i> reliable on 64-bit
	Windows, Linux, and everything down to Windows 98 SE, and therefore also
	real PC-98 hardware. Pretty good, I'd say.
</p><p>
	(If it weren't for that weird crash of the 16-bit <code>TASM.EXE</code> in
	that Windows 95 command prompt I've tried it in, it would also work on
	that OS. Probably just a misconfiguration on my part?)
</p><p>
	Now, it might look like a waste of time to improve a 32-bit build part
	that won't even exist anymore once this project is done. However, a fully
	16-bit DOS build will only make sense after
	<ul>
		<li>master.lib has been turned into a proper library, linked in by
		<code>TLINK</code> rather than <code>#include</code>d in the big .ASM
		files.</li>
		<li>This affects all games. If master.lib's data was consistently
		placed at the beginning or end of each data segment, this would be no
		big deal, but it's placed somewhere else in every binary.</li>
		<li>So, this will only make sense sometime around 90% overall PI, and
		maybe ~50% RE <i>in each game</i>. Which is something else than 50%
		overall â€“ <i>especially</i> since it includes TH02, the objectively
		worst Touhou game, which hasn't received <i>any</i> dedicated funding
		ever.</li>
		<li>Then, it will probably still require a couple of dedicated pushes
		to move all the remaining data to C land.</li>
		<li>Oh, and my 16-bit build system project also needs to be done
		before, because, again, Makefiles are trash and we shouldn't rely on
		them even more.</li>
	</ul>
	And who knows whether this project will get funded for that long. So yeah,
	the 32-bit build part will stay with us for quite some more time, and for
	all upcoming PI milestones. And with the current build process, it's
	pretty much the most minor among all the minor issues I can think of.
	Let's all enjoy the performance of a 32-bit build while we can ðŸ™‚
</p><p>
	Next up: Paying some technical debt while keeping the RE% and PI% in place.
