	Wouldn't it be a bit disappointing to have TH05 completely
	position-independent, but have it still require hex-editing of the
	original <code>ZUN.COM</code> to mod its gaiji characters? As in, these
	custom "text" glyphs, available to the PC-98 text RAM:
</p><figure><a
	href="{{$pic}}"><img src="{{$pic}}" alt="TH05 gaiji characters" /></a></figure
><p>
	Especially since we now even have a sprite converter… the lack of which
	was exactly {{Blog_PostLink "2020-02-23" "what made rebuilding <code>ZUN.COM</code> not that worthwhile before"}}.
	So, before the big release, let's get all the remaining
	<code>ZUN.COM</code> sub-binaries of TH04 and TH05 dumped into .ASM files,
	and re-assembled and linked during the build process.
</p><p>
	This is also the moment in which {{DB_CustomerByID 7}}'s 2018
	reimplementation of O.&nbsp;Morikawa's <code>comcstm</code> finally gets
	to shine. Back then, I considered it too early to even bother with
	<code>ZUN.COM</code> and reimplementing the .COM wrapper that ZUN
	originally used to bundle multiple smaller executables into that single
	binary. But now that the time is right, it <i>is</i> nice to have that
	code, as it allowed me to get these rebuilds done in half a push.
	Otherwise, it would have surely required one or two dedicated ones.
</p><p>
	Since we like correctness here, newly dumped ZUN code means that it also
	has to be included in <a href="/progress/{{ReC98_REBaselineRev}}">the RE%
	baseline calculation</a>. This is why TH04's and TH05's overall RE% bars
	have gone back a tiny bit… in case you remember how they previously looked
	like {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} After all, I <i>would</i> like to figure
	out where all that memory allocated during TH04's and TH05's memory check
	is freed, if at all.
</p><hr /><p>
	Alright, one half of a push left… Y'know, getting rid of those last few PI
	false positives is actually one of the most annoying chores in this
	project, and quite stressful as well: I have to convince myself that the
	remaining false positives are, in fact, not memory references, but with
	way too little time for in-depth RE and to denote what they are
	<i>instead</i>. In that situation, <i>everyone</i> (including myself!)
	<i>is anticipating that PI goal, and no one is really interested in RE</i>.
	(Well… that is, until they actually get to developing their mod. But more
	on that tomorrow. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}) Which means that it boils
	down to quite some hasty, dumb, and superficial RE around those remaining
	numbers.
</p><p>
	So, in the hope of making it less annoying for the other 4 games in the
	future, let's systematically cover the sources of those remaining false
	positives in TH05, over all games. I/O port accesses with either the port
	or the value in registers (and thus, no longer as an immediate argument to
	the <code>IN</code> or <code>OUT</code> instructions, which the PI counter
	can clearly ingore), palette color arithmetic, or heck, 0xFF constants that
	obviously just mean "-1" and are <i>not</i> a reference to offset 0xFF in
	the data segment. All of this, of course, once again had a way bigger
	effect on everything <i>but</i> an almost position-independent TH05… but
	hey, that's the sort of thing you reserve the "anything" pushes for. And
	that's also how we get some of the single biggest PI% gains we have seen
	so far, and will be seeing before the 100% PI mark. And yes, those will
	continue in the next push.
</p><p>
	Alright! Big release tomorrow…
