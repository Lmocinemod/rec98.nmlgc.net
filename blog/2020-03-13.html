	Last of the 3 weeks of almost full-time ReC98 work, supposedly the least
	stressful one, and then things still get delayed thanks to illness üòï In
	better news though, it looks like I'll be able to extend these 3 weeks to
	<i>8</i>, as my RL is shutting down for coronavirus reasons. I'm going to
	wait a bit for the dust to settle before raising the crowdfunding cap
	though, since RL might give me more to do from home after all. I may or
	may not also get commissioned for a non-Touhou translation patch project
	to be worked on in that time‚Ä¶

	The .GRP file functions turned out to, of course, also be present in
	<code>FUUIN.EXE</code>. In fact, that binary had the largest share of
	progress in this push, since it's the only one to include <i>another</i>
	reimplementation of master.lib-style hardware palette fading. As a typical
	little ZUN inconsistency, the <code>FUUIN.EXE</code> version of one .GRP
	palette function directly calls one of these functions.
</p><p>
	As for the functions themselves, they basically wrap the single-function
	<a href="https://www.vector.co.jp/soft/dos/prog/se037608.html">Pi load and
	display library by ÈõªËÑ≥ÁßëÂ≠¶Á†îÁ©∂ÊâÄ/BERO</a> in a bowl of global state
	spaghetti. üçù At least the function names now clearly encode important
	side effects like, y'know, a changed hardware palette. The reason ZUN used
	this separate library over master.lib's PI loading functions was probably
	its support for defining a color as transparent. This feature is used for
	the red box in the main menu, and the large cyan Siddha·πÉ seed syllables in
	(again) the Konngara fight.

	Next up, we've got the .PTN format!
