	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expanded_memory">EMS memory</a>! The
	infamous stopgap measure between the 640 KiB ("ought to be enough for
	everyone") of <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conventional_memory">conventional
	memory</a> offered by DOS from the very beginning, and the later <a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extended_memory">XMS standard</a> for
	accessing all the rest of memory up to 4 GiB in the x86 Protected Mode. With
	an optionally active EMS driver, TH04 and TH05 will make use of EMS memory
	to preload a bunch of situational .CDG images at the beginning of
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code>:
	<ol>
		<li>The "eye catch" game title image, shown while stages are loaded</li>
		<li>The character-specific background image, shown while bombing</li>
		<li>The player character dialog portraits</li>
		<li>TH05 additionally stores the boss portraits there, preloading them
		at the beginning of each stage. (TH04 instead keeps them in conventional
		memory during the entire stage.)</li>
	</ol>
	Once these images are needed, they can then be copied into conventional
	memory and accessed as usual.
</p><p>
	Uh‚Ä¶ wait, <i>copied</i>? It certainly would have been possible to map EMS
	memory to a regular 16-bit Real Mode segment for direct access,
	bank-switching out rarely used system or peripheral memory in exchange for
	the EMS data. However, master.lib doesn't expose this functionality, and
	only provides functions for copying data from EMS to regular memory and vice
	versa.<br />
	But even that still makes EMS an excellent fit for the large image files
	it's used for, as it's possible to directly copy their pixel data from EMS
	to VRAM. (Yes, I tried!) Well‚Ä¶ <i>would</i>, because ZUN doesn't do
	<i>that</i> either, and always naively copies the images to newly allocated
	conventional memory first. In essence, this dumbs down EMS into just another
	layer of the memory hierarchy, inserted between conventional memory and
	disk: Not quite as slow as disk, but still requiring that
	<code>memcpy()</code> to retrieve the data. Most importantly though: Using
	EMS in this way does <i>not</i> increase the total amount of memory
	simultaneously accessible to the game. After all, some other data will have
	to be freed from conventional memory to make room for the newly loaded data.
</p><hr /><p>
	The most idiomatic way to define the game-specific layout of the EMS area
	would be either a <code>struct</code> or an <code>enum</code>.
	Unfortunately, the total size of all these images exceeds the range of a
	16-bit value, and Turbo C++ 4.0J supports neither 32-bit <code>enum</code>s
	(which are silently degraded to 16-bit) nor 32-bit <code>struct</code>s
	(which simply don't compile). That still leaves raw compile-time constants
	though, you only have to manually define the offset to each image in terms
	of the size of its predecessor. But instead of doing that, ZUN just placed
	each image at a nice round decimal offset, each slightly larger than the
	actual memory required by the previous image, just to make sure that
	everything fits. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} This results not only in quite
	a bit of unnecessary padding, but also in <i>technically</i> the single
	biggest amount of "wasted" memory in PC-98 Touhou: Out of the 180,000 (TH04)
	and 320,000 (TH05) EMS bytes requested, the game only uses 135,552 (TH04)
	and 175,904 (TH05) bytes. But hey, it's EMS, so who cares, right? Out of all
	the opportunities to take shortcuts during development, this is among the
	most acceptable ones. Any actual PC-98 model that could run these two games
	comes with plenty of memory for this to not turn into an actual issue.
<p><p>
	On to the EMS-using functions themselves, which are the definition of
	"cross-cutting concerns". Most of these have a fallback path for the non-EMS
	case, and keep the loaded .CDG images in memory if they are immediately
	needed. Which totally makes sense, but also makes it difficult to find names
	that reflect all the global state changed by these functions. Every one of
	these is also just called from a single place, so <a
	href="http://number-none.com/blow/john_carmack_on_inlined_code.html">inlining
	them</a> would have saved me a lot of naming and documentation trouble
	there.<br />
	The TH04 version of the EMS allocation code was actually <a
	href="https://youtu.be/g3C5jMbTtps?t=577">displayed on ZUN's monitor in the
	2010 MAG„Éª„Éç„ÉÉ„Éà documentary</a>; <a
	href="https://twitter.com/WindowsTiger">WindowsTiger</a> already <a
	href="https://pastebin.com/hgPQTBqW">transcribed the low-quality video image
	in 2019</a>. By 2015 ReC98 standards, I would have just run with that, but
	the current project goal is to write better code than ZUN, so I didn't. üòõ
	We sure ain't going to use magic numbers for EMS offsets.
</p><p>
	The dialog init and exit code then is completely different in both games,
	yet equally cross-cutting. TH05 goes even further in saving conventional
	memory, loading each individual player or boss portrait into a single .CDG
	slot immediately before blitting it to VRAM and freeing the pixel data
	again. People who play TH05 without an active EMS driver are surely going to
	enjoy the hard drive access lag between each portrait change‚Ä¶
	{{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}} TH04, on the other hand, also abuses the dialog
	exit function to preload the Mugetsu defeat / Gengetsu entrance and
	Gengetsu defeat portraits, using a static variable to track how often the
	function has been called during the Extra Stage‚Ä¶ who needs function
	parameters anyway, right? {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}
<p></p>
	This is also the function in which TH04 infamously crashes after the Stage 5
	pre-boss dialog when playing with Reimu and without any active EMS driver.
	That crash is what motivated this look into the games' EMS usage‚Ä¶ but the
	code looks perfectly fine? Oh well, guess the crash is not related to EMS
	then. Next u‚Äì
<p></p>
	OK, of course I can't leave it like that. Everyone is expecting a fix now,
	and I still got half of a push left over after decompiling the regular EMS
	code. Also, I've now RE'd every function that could possibly be involved in
	the crash, and this is very likely to be the last time I'll be looking at
	them.
</p><hr /><p>
	Turns out that the bug has little to do with EMS, and everything to do with
	ZUN limiting the amount of conventional RAM that TH04's
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code> is allowed to use, and then slightly miscalculating
	this upper limit. Playing Stage 5 with Reimu is the most asset-intensive
	configuration in this game, due to the combination of<ul>
		<li>6 player portraits (Marisa has only 5), at 128√ó128 pixels each</li>
		<li>a 288√ó256 background for the boss fight, tied in size only with the
		ones in the Extra Stage</li>
		<li>the additional 96√ó80 image for the vertically scrolling stars during
		the stage, wastefully stored as 4 bitplanes rather than a single one.
		This image is never freed, not even at the end of the stage.</li>
	</ul>

	<small>The star image used in TH04's Stage 5.</small>
</p><p>
	Remove any single one of the above points, and this crash would have never
	occurred. But with all of them combined, the total amount of memory consumed
	by TH04's <code>MAIN.EXE</code> just barely exceeds ZUN's limit of 320,000
	bytes, by no more than 3.840 bytes, the size of the star image.
</p><p>
	But wait: As we established earlier, EMS does nothing to reduce the amount
	of conventional memory used by the game. In fact, if you disabled TH04's EMS
	handling, you'd still get this crash even if you <i>are</i> running an EMS
	driver and loaded DOS into the High Memory Area to free up as much
	conventional RAM as possible. How can EMS then prevent this crash in the
	first place?
</p><p>
	The answer: It's only because ZUN's usage of EMS bypasses the need to load
	the cached images back out of the XOR-encrypted <code>Êù±ÊñπÂπªÊÉ≥.ÈÉ∑</code>
	packfile. Leaving aside the <span
		class="hovertext"
		title="Please, don't ever do this! Think of all the constructive things that hackers could do in the time they spend reverse-engineering your packfile encryption!">general
	stupidity of any game data file encryption*</span>, master.lib's decryption
	implementation is also quite wasteful: It uses a separate buffer that
	receives fixed-size chunks of the file, before decrypting every individual
	byte and copying it to its intended destination buffer. That really
	resembles the typical slowness of a C <code>fread()</code> implementation
	more than it does the highly optimized ASM code that master.lib purports to
	be‚Ä¶ And how large is this well-hidden decryption buffer? 4 KiB.
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	So, looking back at the game, here is what happens once the Stage 5
	pre-battle dialog ends:
	<ol>
		<li>Reimu's bomb background image, which was previously freed to make
		space for her dialog portraits, has to be loaded back into conventional
		memory from disk</li>
		<li><code>BB0.CDG</code> is found inside the <code>Êù±ÊñπÂπªÊÉ≥.ÈÉ∑</code>
		packfile</li>
		<li><code>file_ropen</code> ends up allocating a 4 KiB buffer for the
		encrypted packfile data, getting us the decisive ~4 KiB closer to the
		memory limit</li>
		<li>The .CDG loader tries to allocate 52.608 contiguous bytes for the
		pixel data of Reimu's bomb image</li>
		<li>This would exceed the memory limit, so <code>hmem_allocbyte()</code>
		fails and returns a <code>nullptr</code></li>
		<li>ZUN doesn't check for this case (as usual)</li>
		<li>The pixel data is loaded to address <code>0000:0000</code>,
		overwriting the Interrupt Vector Table and whatever comes after</li>
		<li>The game crashes</li>
	</ol>
</p><p class="gallery"><a href="{{$pic}}"><img

	<small>The final frame rendered by a crashing TH04.</small>
</p><p>
	The 4 KiB encryption buffer would only be released by the corresponding
	<code>file_close()</code> call, which of course never happens because the
	game crashes before it gets there. At one point, I really did suspect the
	cause to be some kind of memory leak or fragmentation inside master.lib,
	which would have been quite delightful to fix.<br />
	Instead, the most straightforward fix here is to bump up that memory limit
	by at least 4 KiB. Certainly easier than squeezing in a
	<code>cdg_free()</code> call for the star image before the pre-boss dialog
	without breaking position dependence.
</p><p>
	<i>Or</i>, even better, let's nuke all these memory limits from orbit
	because they make little sense to begin with, and fix every other potential
	out-of-memory crash that modders would encounter when adding enough data to
	any of the 4 games that impose such limits on themselves. Unless you want to
	launch other binaries (which need to do their own memory allocations) after
	launching the game, there's really no reason to restrict the amount of
	memory available to a DOS process. Heck, whenever DOS creates a new one, it
	assigns all remaining free memory by default anyway.<br />
	Removing the memory limits also removes one of ZUN's few error checks, which
	end up quitting the game if there isn't at least a given maximum amount of
	conventional RAM available. While it might be tempting to reserve enough
	memory at the beginning of execution and then never check any allocation for
	a potential failure, that's <i>exactly</i> where something like TH04's crash
	comes from.<br />
	This game is also still running on DOS, where such an initial allocation
	failure is very unlikely to happen ‚Äì no one fills close to half of
	conventional RAM with TSRs and then tries running one of these games. It
	<i>might</i> have been useful to detect systems with less than 640 KiB of
	actual, physical RAM, but none of the PC-98 models with that little amount
	of memory are fast enough to run these games to begin with. How ironic‚Ä¶ a
	place where ZUN actually added an error check, and then it's mostly
	pointless.

	So yeah, quite a complex bug, leaving no time for the TH03 scorefile format
	research after all. Next up: Raising prices.
