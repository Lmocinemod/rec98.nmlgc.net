	Deathbombs confirmed, in both TH04 and TH05! On the surface, it's the same
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4du_rEB0M88">8-frame window as in
	most Windows games</a>, but due to the slightly lower PC-98 frame rate of
	56.4&nbsp;Hz, it's actually slightly more lenient in TH04 and TH05.
</p><p>
	The last function in front of the TH05 shot type control functions marks
	the player's previous position in VRAM to be redrawn. But as it turns out,
	"player" not only means "the player's option satellites on shot levels ≥
	2", but also "the explosion animation if you lose a life", which required
	reverse-engineering both things, ultimately leading to the confirmation of
	deathbombs.
</p><p>
	It actually was kind of surprising that we then had reverse-engineered
	everything related to <i>rendering</i> all three things mentioned above,
	and could also cover the player rendering function right now. Luckily,
	TH05 didn't decide to also micro-optimize <i>that</i> function into
	un-decompilability; in fact, it wasn't changed at all from TH04. Unlike
	the one invalidation function whose decompilation would have
	<i>actually</i> been the goal here…
</p><p>
	But now, we've finally gotten to where we wanted to… and only got 2
	outstanding decompilation pushes left. Time to get the website ready for
	hosting an actual crowdfunding campaign, I'd say – It'll make a better
	impression if people can still see things being delivered after the big
	announcement.
