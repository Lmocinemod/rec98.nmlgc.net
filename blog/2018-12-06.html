<p>Let's start this stretch with a pretty simple entity type, the growing and shrinking circles shown during bomb animations and around bosses in TH04 and TH05. Which can be drawn in varying colorsâ€¦ wait, what's all this inlined and duplicated GRCG mode and color setting code? Let's move that out into macros too, it takes up too much space when grepping for constants, and will raise a "wait, what was <i>that</i> I/O port doing again" question for most people reading the code again after a few months.</p>

<p>ðŸŽ‰ With this push, we've also hit a milestone! Less than 200,000 unknown x86 instructions remain until we've completely reverse-engineered all of PC-98 Touhou.</p>
