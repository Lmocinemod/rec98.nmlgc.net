	Of course, Sariel's potentially bloated and copy-pasted code is blocked by
	even more definitely bloated and copy-pasted code. It's TH01, what did you
	expect? {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	But even then, TH01's item code is on a new level of software architecture
	ridiculousness. First, ZUN uses distinct arrays for both types of items,
	with their own caps of 4 for bomb items, and 10 for point items. Since that
	obviously makes any type-related <code>switch</code> statement redundant,
	he also used distinct <i>functions</i> for both types, with copy-pasted
	boilerplate code. The main per-item update and render function <i>is</i>
	shared though… and takes <i>every single accessed member of the item
	structure as its own reference parameter</i>. Like, why, you have a
	structure, right there?! That's one way to really practice the C++ language
	concept of passing arbitrary structure fields by mutable reference…
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}<br />
	To complete the unwarranted grand generic design of this function, it calls
	back into per-type collision detection, drop, and collect functions with
	another three reference parameters. Yeah, why use C++ virtual methods when
	you can also implement the effectively same polymorphism functionality by
	hand? Oh, and the coordinate clamping code in one of these callbacks could
	only possibly have come from nested <code>min()</code> and
	<code>max()</code> preprocessor macros. And that's how you extend such
	dead-simple functionality to 1¼ pushes…
</p><p>
	Amidst all this jank, we've at least got a sensible item↔player hitbox this
	time, with 24 pixels around Reimu's center point to the left and right, and
	extending from 24 pixels above Reimu down to the bottom of the playfield.
	It absolutely didn't look like that from the initial naive decompilation
	though. Changing entity coordinates from left/top to center was one of the
	better lessons from TH01 that ZUN implemented in later games, it really
	makes collision detection code much more intuitive to grasp.

	The card flip code is where we find out some slightly more interesting
	aspects about item drops in this game, and how they're controlled by a
	hidden cycle variable:
</p><ul>
	<li>At the beginning of every 5-stage scene, this variable is set to a
	random value in the [0..59] range</li>
	<li>Point items are dropped at every multiple of 10</li>
	<li>Every card flip adds 1 to its value after this <code>mod 10</code>
	check</li>
	<li>At a value of 140, the point item is replaced with a bomb item, but only
	if no damaging bomb is active. In any case, its value is then reset to
	1.</li>
</ul><p>
	<s>Then again, score players largely ignore point items anyway, as card
	combos simply have a much bigger effect on the score. With this, I should
	have RE'd all information necessary to construct a tool-assisted score run,
	though?</s><br />
	<strong>Edit:</strong> Turns out that 1) point items are becoming
	increasingly important in score runs, and 2) Pearl already did a TAS some
	months ago. Thanks to

	The Orb↔card hitbox also makes perfect sense, with 24 pixels around
	the center point of a card in every direction.
</p><p>
	The rest of the code confirms the
	<a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/Highly_Responsive_to_Prayers/Gameplay#Cards">card
	flip score formula documented on Touhou Wiki</a>, as well as the way cards
	are flipped by bombs: During every of the 90 "damaging" frames of the
	140-frame bomb animation, there is a 75% chance to flip the card at the
	<code>[bomb_frame % total_card_count_in_stage]</code> array index. Since
	stages can only have up to 50 cards
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-30" "thanks to a bug"}}, even a 75% chance is high
	enough to typically flip most cards during a bomb. Each of these flips
	still only removes a single card HP, just like after a regular collision
	with the Orb.<br />
	Also, why are the card score popups rendered <i>before</i> the cards
	themselves? That's two needless frames of flicker during that 25-frame
	animation. Not all too noticeable, but still.
</p><hr /><p>
	And that's over 50% of <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> decompiled as well! Next
	up: More HUD update and rendering code… with a direct dependency on
	<s>rank</s> pellet speed modifications?
