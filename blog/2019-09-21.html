	The glacial pace continues, with TH05's unnecessarily, inappropriately
	micro-optimized, and hence, un-decompilable code for rendering the current
	and high score, as well as the enemy health / dream / power bars. While
	the latter might still pass as well-written ASM, the former goes to such
	ridiculous levels that it ends up being <i>technically</i> buggy. If you
	enjoy <a href="https://twitter.com/zun_code">quality ZUN code</a>, it's
	definitely worth a read.
</p><p>
	In TH05, this all still is at the end of code segment #1, but in TH04,
	the same code lies all over the same segment. And since I <i>really</i>
	wanted to move that code into its final form <i>now</i>, I finally did the
	research into decompiling from anywhere else in a segment.
</p><p>
	Turns out we actually can! It's kinda annoying, though: After splitting
	the segment after the function we want to decompile, we then need to group
	the two new segments back together into one "virtual segment" matching the
	original one. <i>But</i> since all ASM in ReC98 heavily relies on being
	assembled in MASM mode, we then start to suffer from MASM's group
	addressing quirk. Which then forces us to manually prefix every single
	function call
</p><ul>
	<li>from inside the group</li>
	<li>to anywhere else within the newly created segment</li>
</ul><p>
	with the group name. It's stupidly boring busywork, because of all the
	function calls you <i>mustn't</i> prefix. Special tooling might make this
	easier, but I don't have it, and I'm not getting crowdfunded for it.
</p><p>
	So while you now definitely <i>can</i> request any specific thing in any
	of the 5 games to be decompiled <i>right now</i>, it will take slightly
	longer, and cost slightly more.<br>
	(Except for that one big segment in TH04, of course.)
</p><p>
	Only one function away from the TH05 shot type control functions now!
