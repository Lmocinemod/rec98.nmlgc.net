	Did <a href="https://twitter.com/WindowsTiger">WindowsTiger</a> just cover
	2% over all games <a href="https://github.com/wintiger0222/ReC98">on his
	own</a>? While not all of that passed my review, +1.59% RE and +1.66% PI
	over all 5 games is still pretty noteworthy, and comfortably pushes TH05
	over the 25% mark in RE, and the 60% mark in PI.
</p><p>
	<b><i>However.</i></b>
</p><p>
	While I definitely do appreciate such contributions, reviewing and
	adapting these to my current code organization standards also takes more
	time than I'd like it to take. And taken to this level, it <i>does</i>
	kind of undermine this crowdfunding project, causing both a <i>literal</i>
	denial of service and exactly the stress that this crowdfunding was
	designed to avoid. Most of the time, I can't merge all of that as-is
	without knowingly creating annoyances down the line. But I don't want to
	just ignore it either, or reject every non-perfect commit…<br />
	That's also why I let it slide this time, due to some of the RE work in
	there being genuinely amazing. In the future though, be aware that your
	chance of having your work merged diminishes the further you move ahead of
	my current <tt>master</tt> branch. In extreme cases like this one, I'll
	then just be waiting until enough generic reverse-engineering pushes have
	accrued, and treat the merge as regular work.
</p><p>
	But now, time to continue with the regular programming… I <i>am</i> kind
	of exhausted from all of this, so no bullets for the next two
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}} pushes, still… Good thing there's still plenty of
	simpler things with big percentage gains to be done:
</p><ul>
	<li>WindowsTiger mostly focused on <tt>OP.EXE</tt> which I tended to
	neglect, as the big <tt>MAIN</tt> executables seemed to be more
	interesting to my backers. (It's not like anyone ever <i>requested</i>
	<tt>OP</tt> to be done either – like, who even cares about boring menu
	source code, right?) Good that I therefore sort of left it as low-hanging
	fruit to be grabbed by outside contributors – because now, TH04's and
	TH05's <tt>OP.EXE</tt> are close to 100% position-independence. The <tt>
	GENSOU.SCR</tt> format is pretty much the only thing missing there right
	now, so let's finally go all the way there, I'd say.</li>
	<li>And in TH05, there's still Reimu's shot type functions left to be
	decompiled.</li>
</ul>
