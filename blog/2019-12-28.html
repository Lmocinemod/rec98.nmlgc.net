	<i>Almost!</i>
</p><p>
	Just like most of the time, it was more sensible to cover
	<tt>GENSOU.SCR</tt>, the last structure missing in TH05's <tt>OP.EXE</tt>,
	everywhere it's used, rather than just rushing out <tt>OP.EXE</tt>
	position independence. I did have to look into all of the functions to
	fully RE it after all, and to find out whether the unused fields actually
	<i>are</i> unused. The only thing that kept this push from yielding even
	more above-average progress was the sheer inconsistency in how the games
	implemented the operations on this PC-98 equivalent of <tt>score*.dat</tt>:
</p><ul>
	<li><tt>OP.EXE</tt> declares two structure instances, for simultaneous
	access to both Reimu and Marisa scores. TH05 with its 4 playable
	characters instead uses a single one, and overwrites it successively for
	each character when drawing the high score menu – meaning, you'd only see
	Yuuka's scores when looking at the structure inside the rendered high
	score menu. However, it still declares the TH04 "Marisa" structure as a
	leftover… <i>and also decodes it and verifies its checksum</i>, despite
	nothing being ever loaded into it</li>
	<li><tt>MAIN.EXE</tt> uses a separate ASM implementation of the decoding
	and encoding functions {{HTML_Emoji "godzun"}}</li>
	<li>TH05's <tt>MAIN.EXE</tt> also reimplements the basic loading functions
	in ASM – <i>without</i> the code to regenerate <tt>GENSOU.SCR</tt> with
	default data if the file is missing or corrupted. That actually makes
	sense, since any regeneration is already done in <tt>OP.EXE</tt>, which
	always has to load that file anyway to check how much has been cleared
	</li>
	<li>However, there <i>is</i> a regeneration function in TH05's
	<tt>MAINE.EXE</tt>… which actually generates <i>different</i> default
	data: <tt>OP.EXE</tt> consistently sets Extra Stage records to Stage 1,
	while <tt>MAINE.EXE</tt> uses the same place-based stage numbering that
	both versions use for the regular ranks</li>
</ul><p>
	<i>Technically</i> though, TH05's <tt>OP.EXE</tt> <i>is</i>
	position-independent now, and the rest are (<i>should</i> be?
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}) merely false positives. However, TH04's is
	still missing another structure, in addition to <i>its</i> false
	positives. So, let's wait with the big announcement until the next push…
	which will also come with a demo video of what will be possible then.
