<p>Laser… is not difficult. In fact, out of the remaining entity types I checked, it's the easiest one to fully grasp from uth05win alone, as it's only drawn using master.lib's line, circle, and polygon functions. Everything else ends up calling… something sprite-related that needs to be RE'd separately, and which uth05win doesn't help with, at all.</p>

<p>Oh, and since the speed of shoot-out lasers (as used by TH05's Stage 2 boss, for example) always depends on rank, we also got this variable now.</p>

<p>This only covers the structure itself – uth05win's member names for the <code>LASER</code> structure were not only a bit too unclear, but also plain wrong and misleading in one instance. The actual implementation will follow in the next one.</p>
