	Turns out that TH04's player selection menu is exactly three times as
	complicated as TH05's. Two screens for character and shot type rather than
	one, and a way more intricate implementation for saving and restoring the
	background behind the raised top and left edges of a character picture
	when moving the cursor between Reimu and Marisa. TH04 decides to backup
	precisely only the two 256×8 (top) and 8×244 (left) strips behind the
	edges, indicated in <span style="color: red;">red</span> in the picture
	below.

><p>
	These take up just 4 KB of heap memory… but require custom blitting
	functions, and expanding this explicitly hardcoded approach to TH05's 4
	characters would have been pretty annoying. So, rather than, uh, <i>not</i>
	explicitly hardcoding it all, ZUN decided to just be lazy with the backup
	area in TH05, saving the entire 640×400 screen, and thus spending 128 KB
	of heap memory on this rather simple selection shadow effect.

	So, this really wasn't something to quickly get done during the first half
	of a push, even after already having done TH05's equivalent of this menu.
	But since life is very busy right now, I also used the occasion to start
	addressing another code organization annoyance: master.lib's single <code>master.h</code> header file.
</p><ul>
	<li>Now that ReC98 is trying to develop (or at least mimic) a more
	type-safe C++ foundation to model the PC-98 hardware, a pure C header
	(with counter-productive C++ extensions) is becoming increasingly
	unidiomatic. By moving some of the original assumptions about function
	parameters into the type system, we can also reduce the reliance on its
	Japanese-only documentation without having to translate it
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}</li>
	<li>It's far from complete with regards to providing compile-time PC-98
	hardware constants and helpful types. In fact,
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/f6a3246/planar.h">we started
	to add these in our own header files</a>
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/f6a3246/pc98.h">a long time
	ago</a>.</li>
	<li>It's quite bloated, with <i>at least</i> 2800 lines of code that
	currently are <code>#include</code>d into the vast majority of files, not
	counting <code>master.h</code>'s recursively included C standard library
	headers. PC-98 Touhou only makes direct use of a rather small fraction of
	its contents.</li>
	<li>And finally, all the DOS/V compatibility definitions are especially
	useless in the context of ReC98. As I've noted
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-04" "time"}} and
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-17" "time"}} again, porting PC-98 Touhou to
	IBM-compatible DOS won't be easy, and <code>MASTER_DOSV</code> won't be
	helping much. Therefore, my upstream version of ReC98 will never include
	all of master.lib. There's no point in lengthening compile times for
	everyone by default, and those <i>will</i> be getting quite noticeable
	after moving to a full 16-bit build process.<br />
	(Actually, what retro system ports should <i>rather</i> be doing: Get rid
	of master.lib's original ASM code, replace it with
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zBkNBP00wJE">readable, modern
	C++, and then simply convert the optimized assembly output of modern
	compilers to your ISA of choice</a>. Improving the landscape of such
	assembly or object file converters would benefit everyone!)
</ul><p>
	So, time to start a new <code>master.hpp</code> header that would contain
	just the declarations from <code>master.h</code> that PC-98 Touhou
	actually needs, plus some semantic (yes, semantic) sugar. Comparing just
	the old <code>master.h</code> to just the new <code>master.hpp</code>
	after roughly 60% of the transition has been completed, we get median
	build times of 319&nbsp;ms for <code>master.h</code>, and 144&nbsp;ms for
	<code>master.hpp</code> on my (admittedly rather slow) DOSBox setup.
	Nice!<br />
	As of this push, ReC98 consists of 107 translation units that have to be
	compiled with Turbo C++ 4.0J. Fully rebuilding all of these currently
	takes roughly 37.5&nbsp;seconds in DOSBox. After the transition to
	<code>master.hpp</code> is done, we could therefore shave some 10 to 15
	seconds off this time, simply by switching header files. And that's just
	the beginning, as this will also pave the way for further
	<code>#include</code> optimizations. Life in this codebase will be great!
</p><hr /><p>
	Unfortunately, there wasn't enough time to repay some of the actual
	technical debt I was looking forward to, after all of this. Oh well, at
	least we now also have nice identifiers for the three different boldface
	options that are used when rendering text to VRAM, after procrastinating
	that issue for almost 11 months. Next up, assuming the existing
	subscriptions: More ridiculous decompilations of things that definitely
	<i>weren't</i> originally written in C, and a big blocker in TH03's
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code>.
