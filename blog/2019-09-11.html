	Back to actual development! Starting off this stretch with something
	fairly mechanical, the few remaining generic boss and midboss state
	variables. And once we start converting the constant numbers used for and
	around those variables into decimal, the estimated position independence
	probability immediately jumped by 5.31% for TH04's <code>MAIN.EXE</code>,
	and 4.49% for TH05's – despite not having made the game any more position-
	independent than it was before. Yup… lots of false positives in there, but
	who can really know for sure without having put in the work.

	But now, we've RE'd enough to finally decompile something again next,
	4 years after the last decompilation of anything!
