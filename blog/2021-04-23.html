	Technical debt, part 9â€¦ and as it turns out, it's highly impractical to
	repay 100% of it at this point in development. ðŸ˜•
</p><p>
	The reason: <code>graph_putsa_fx()</code>, ZUN's function for rendering
	optionally boldfaced text to VRAM using the font ROM glyphs, in its
	ridiculously micro-optimized TH04 and TH05 version. This one sets the
	"callback function" for applying the boldface effect by self-modifying
	<i>the target of two <code>CALL rel16</code> instructions</i>â€¦ because
	there <i>really</i> wasn't any free register left for an indirect
	<code>CALL</code>, eh? The necessary distance, from the call site to the
	function itself, has to be calculated at assembly time, by subtracting the
	target function label from the call site label.<br />
	This usually wouldn't be a problemâ€¦ if ZUN didn't store the resulting
	lookup tables in the <code>.DATA</code> segment. With code segments, we
	can easily split them at pretty much any point between functions because
	there are multiple of them. But there's only a single <code>.DATA</code>
	segment, with all ZUN and master.lib data sandwiched between Borland C++'s
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crt0"><code>crt0</code></a> at the
	top, and Borland C++'s library functions at the bottom of the segment.
	Adding another split point would require all data after that point to be
	moved to its own translation unit, which in turn requires
	<code>EXTERN</code> references in the big .ASM file to all that moved
	dataâ€¦ in short, it would turn the codebase into an even greater
	mess.<br />
	Declaring the labels as <code>EXTERN</code> wouldn't work either, since
	the linker can't do fancy arithmetic and is limited to simply replacing
	address placeholders with one single address. So, we're now stuck with
	this function at the bottom of the <code>SHARED</code> segment, for the
	foreseeable future.
</p><hr /><p>
	We can still continue to separate functions off the top of that segment,
	though. Pretty much the only thing noteworthy there, so far: TH04's code
	for loading stage tile images from .MPN files, which we hadn't
	reverse-engineered so far, and which nicely fit into one of
	{{DB_CustomerByID 15}}'s pending â…“ RE contributions. Yup, we finally moved
	the RE% bars again! If only for a tiny bit.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}<br />
	Both TH02 and TH05 simply store one pointer to one dynamically allocated
	memory block for all tile images, as well as the number of images, in the
	data segment. TH04, on the other hand, reserves memory for 8 .MPN slots,
	complete with their color palettes, even though it only ever uses the
	first one of these. There goes another 458 bytes of conventional RAMâ€¦ I
	should start summing up all the waste we've seen so far. Let's put the
	next website contribution towards a tagging system for these blog posts.
</p><p>
	At 86% of technical debt in the <code>SHARED</code> segment repaid, we
	aren't quite done yet, but the rest is mostly just TH04 needing to catch
	up with functions we've already separated. Next up: Getting to that
	practical 98.5% point. Since this is very likely to not require a full
	push, I'll also decompile some more actual TH04 and TH05 game code I
	previously reverse-engineered â€“ and after that, reopen the store!
