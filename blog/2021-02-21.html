	Technical debt, part 6… and we <i>only</i> got TH05's stupidly optimized
	.PI functions this time?
</p><p>
	As far as actual progress is concerned, that is. In maintenance news
	though, I was really hyped for the <code>#include</code> improvements I've
	mentioned in {{Blog_PostLink "2021-01-31" "the last post"}}. The result: A
	new <code>x86real.h</code> file, bundling all the declarations specific to
	the 16-bit x86 Real Mode in a smaller file than Turbo C++'s own
	<code>DOS.H</code>. After all, DOS is something else than the underlying
	CPU. And while it didn't speed up build times quite as much as I had hoped,
	it now clearly indicates the x86-specific parts of PC-98 Touhou code to
	future port authors.
</p><p>
	After another couple of improvements to parameter declaration in ASM land,
	we get to TH05's .PI functions… and really, why did ZUN write <i>all of
	them</i> in ASM? Why (re)declare all the necessary structures and data in
	ASM land, when all these functions are merely one layer of abstraction
	above master.lib, which does all the actual work?<br />
	I get that ZUN might have wanted masked blitting to be faster, which is
	used for the fade-in effect seen during TH05's main menu animation and the
	ending artwork. But, uh… he knew how to modify master.lib. In fact, he
	<i>did</i> already modify the <code>graph_pack_put_8()</code> function
	used for rendering a single .PI image row, to ignore master.lib's VRAM
	clipping region. For this effect though, he first blits each row regularly
	to the invisible 400th row of VRAM, and <i>then</i> does an EGC-accelerated
	VRAM-to-VRAM blit of that row to its actual target position with the mask
	enabled. It would have been way more efficient to add another version of
	this function that takes a mask pattern. No amount of <code>REP
	MOVSW</code> is going to change the fact that two VRAM writes per line are
	slower than a single one. Not to mention that it doesn't justify writing
	every other .PI function in ASM to go along with it…<br />
	This is where we also find the most hilarious aspect about this: For most
	of ZUN's pointless micro-optimizations, you could have maybe made the
	argument that they do save <i>some</i> CPU cycles here and there, and
	therefore did something positive to the final, PC-98-exclusive result. But
	some of the hand-written ASM here doesn't even constitute a
	micro-optimization, because it's <i>worse</i> than what you would have got
	out of even Turbo C++ 4.0J with its 80386 optimization flags!

	At least it was <i>possible</i> to "decompile" 6 out of the 10 functions
	here, making them easy to clean up for future modders and port authors.
	Could have been 7 functions if I also decided to "decompile"
	<code>pi_free()</code>, but all the C++ code is already surrounded by ASM,
	resulting in 2 ASM translation units and 2 C++ translation units.
	<code>pi_free()</code> would have needed a single translation unit by
	itself, which wasn't worth it, given that I would have had to spell out
	every single ASM instruction anyway.
</p><pre>void pascal pi_free(int slot)
{
	if(pi_buffers[slot]) {
		graph_pi_free(&pi_headers[slot], &pi_buffers[slot]);
		pi_buffers[slot] = NULL;
	}
}</pre><p>
	There you go. What about this needed to be written in ASM?!?
</p><p>
	The function calls between these small translation units even seemed to
	glitch out TASM and the linker in the end, leading to one <code>CALL</code>
	offset being weirdly shifted by 32 bytes. Usually, TLINK reports a fixup
	overflow error when this happens, but this time it didn't, for some reason?
	Mirroring the segment grouping in the affected translation unit did solve
	the problem, and I already knew this, but only thought of it after spending
	quite some RTFM time… during which I discovered the <code>-lE</code>
	switch, which enables TLINK to use the <i>expanded dictionaries</i> in
	Borland's .OBJ and .LIB files to speed up linking. That shaved off roughly
	another second from the build time of the complete ReC98 repository. The
	more you know… Binary blobs compiled with non-Borland tools would be the
	only reason not to use this flag.
</p><p>
	So, even more slowdown with this 5th dedicated push, since we've still only
	repaid 41% of the technical debt in the <code>SHARED</code> segment so far.
	Next up: Part 6, which hopefully manages to decompile the FM and SSG
	channel animations in TH05's Music Room, and hopefully ends up being the
	final one of the slow ones.
