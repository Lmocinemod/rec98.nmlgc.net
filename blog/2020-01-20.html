	As noted in {{Blog_PostLink "2019-12-05" "P0061"}}, TH03 gameplay RE is
	indeed going to progress <i>very</i> slowly in the beginning. A lot of the
	initial progress won't even be reflected in the RE% – there are just so
	many features in this game that are intertwined into each other, and I
	only consider functions to be "reverse-engineered" once we understand
	<i>every</i> involved piece of code and data, and labeled every absolute
	memory reference in it. (Yes, that means that the percentages on the front
	page are actually underselling ReC98's progress quite a bit, and reflect a
	pretty low bound of our actual understanding of the games.)
</p><p>
	So, when I get asked to look directly at gameplay code <i>right now</i>,
	it's quite the struggle to find a place that can be covered within a push
	or two <i>and</i> that would immediately benefit
	<a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/User:KirbyComment/Phantasmagoria_of_Dimensional_Dream_Info">
	scoreplayers</a>. The basics of score and combo handling themselves
	managed to fit in pretty well, though:
</p><ul>
	<li>Just like TH04 and TH05, TH03 stores the current score as 8
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary-coded_decimal">binary-coded
	decimal</a> digits. Since the last constant 0 is not included, the maximum
	score displayable without glitches therefore is 999,999,990 points, but
	the game will happily store up to 24,699,999,990 points before the score
	wraps back to 0.</li>
	<li>There are (surprisingly?) only 6 places where the game actually
	adds points to the score. Not quite sure about all of them yet, but they
	(of course) include ending a combo, killing enemies, and the bonus at the
	end of a round.</li>
	<li>Combos can be continued for 80 frames after a 2-hit. The hit counter
	can only be increased in the first 48, and effectively resets to 0 for the
	last 32, when the Spell Point value starts blinking.</li>
	<li>TH03 can track a total of 16 independent "hit combo sources" per
	player, simultaneously. These are <i>not</i> related to the number of
	actual explosions; rather, each explosion is assigned to one of the 16
	slots when it spawns, and all consecutive explosions spawned from that one
	will then add to the hit combo in that slot. The hit number displayed in
	the top left is simply the largest one among all these.</li>
</ul><p>
	Oh well, at least we still got a bit of PI% out of this one. From this
	point though, the next push (or two) should be enough to cover the big
	128-byte player structure – which by itself might not be immediately
	interesting to scoreplayers, but surely is quite a blocker for everything
	else.
