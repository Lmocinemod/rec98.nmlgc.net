	So, where to start? Well, TH04 bullets are hard, so let's
	<s>procrastinate</s> start with TH03 instead {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
	The {{Blog_PostLink "2019-11-06" "sprite display functions"}} are the
	obvious blocker for any structure describing a sprite, and therefore most
	meaningful PI gains in that game… and I actually did manage to fit a
	decompilation of those three functions into exactly the amount of time
	that the {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} community votes alloted to TH03
	reverse-engineering!
</p><p>
	And a pretty amazing one at that. The original code was so obviously
	written in ASM and was just barely decompilable by exclusively using
	register pseudovariables and a bit of <code>goto</code>, but I was able to
	abstract most of that away, not least thanks to a few helpful optimization
	properties of Turbo C++… seriously, I can't stop marveling at this ancient
	compiler. The end result is both readable, clear, and dare I say
	<i>portable</i>?! To anyone interested in porting TH03,
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/th03/sprite16.cpp">
	take a look. How painful would it be to port <i>that</i> away from 16-bit
	x86</a>?
</p><p>
	However, this push is also a typical example that the RE/PI priorities can
	only control what I <i>look</i> at, and the outcome can actually differ
	greatly. Even though the priorities were 65% RE and 35% PI, the progress
	outcome was +0.13% RE and +1.35% PI. But hey, we've got one more push with
	a focus on TH03 PI, so maybe <i>that </i> one will include more RE than
	PI, and then everything will end up just as ordered?
