	Now <i>that's</i> more like the speed I was expecting! After a few more
	unused functions for palette fading and rectangle blitting, we've reached
	the big line drawing functions. And the biggest one among <i>them</i>,
	drawing a straight line at any angle between two points using
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bresenham%27s_line_algorithm">
	Bresenham's algorithm</a>, actually happens to be the single longest
	function present in more than one binary in all of PC-98 Touhou, and #23
	on the list of individual longest functions.
</p><p>
	And it <i>technically</i> has a ZUN bug! If you pass a point outside the
	(0, 0) - (639, 399) screen range, the function will calculate a new point
	at the edge of the screen, so that the resulting line will retain the
	angle intended by the points given. Except that it does so by calculating
	the line slope using an integer division rather than a floating-point one
	{{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} Doesn't seem like it actually causes any weirdly
	skewed lines to be drawn in-game, though; that case is only hit in the
	Mima boss fight, which draws a few lines with a bottom coordinate of
	400 rather than the maximum of 399. It <i>might</i> also cause the wrong
	background pixels to be restored during parts of the YuugenMagan fight,
	leading to flickering sprites, but seriously, that's an issue everywhere
	you look in this game.

	Together with the rendering-text-to-VRAM function we've mostly already
	known from TH02, this pushed the total RE percentage well over 20%, and
	almost doubled the TH01 RE percentage, all within three pushes. And
	comparatively, it went <i>really</i> smoothly, to the point (ha) where I
	even had enough time left to also include the single-point functions that
	come next in that code segment. Since about half of the remaining
	functions in <code>OP.EXE</code> are present in more than just itself,
	I'll be able to at least keep up this speed until <code>OP.EXE</code> hits
	the 70% RE mark. That is, as long as the backers' priorities continue to
	be generic RE or "giving some love to TH01"… we don't have a precedent for
	TH01's actual game code yet.
</p><p>
	And that's all the TH01 progress funded for January! Next up, we actually
	<i>do</i> have a focus on TH03's game and scoring mechanics… or at least
	the foundation for that.
