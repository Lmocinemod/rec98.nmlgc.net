	ðŸŽ‰ TH05 is finally fully position-independent! ðŸŽ‰ To celebrate this
	milestone, {{DB_CustomerByID 2}} coded a little demo, which we recorded on
	both an emulator and on real PC-98 hardware:
	<script>
		externalRegister('{{.Date}}', 'hw', 'https://youtube.com/embed/0BmzWRgv27A');
		externalRegister('{{.Date}}', 'emu', 'https://youtube.com/embed/7-UYGhZ1sB8');
	</script>
</p><figure class="side_by_side">

	<iframe id="{{.Date}}-emu" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure><p>
	For all the new people who are unfamiliar with PC-98 Touhou internals:
	<a href="/faq#three">Boss behavior is hardcoded into
	<code>MAIN.EXE</code>, rather than being scriptable via separate .ECL
	files like in Windows Touhou</a>. That's what makes this kind of a big
	deal.
</p><hr /><h5>What does this mean?</h5><p>
	You can now freely add or remove both data and code anywhere in TH05, by
	editing the ReC98 codebase, writing your mod in ASM or C/C++, and
	recompiling the code. Since all absolute memory addresses have now been
	converted to labels, this will work without causing any instability. See
	the <a href="/faq#pi-what">position independence section in the FAQ</a>
	for a more thorough explanation about why this was a problem.
</p><p>
	By extension, this also means that it's now <i>theoretically</i> possible
	to use a different compiler on the source code. <strong>But:</strong>
</p><h5>What does this not mean?</h5><p>
	The original ZUN code hasn't been completely reverse-engineered yet, let
	alone decompiled. As the final PC-98 Touhou game, TH05 also happens to
	have the largest amount of actual ZUN-written ASM that can't <i>ever</i>
	be decompiled within ReC98's constraints of a legit source code
	reconstruction. But a lot of the originally-in-C code is also still in
	ASM, which might make modding a bit inconvenient right now. And while I
	<i>have</i> decompiled a bunch of functions, I selected them largely
	because they would help with PI (as requested by the backers), and not
	because they are particularly relevant to typical modding interests.
</p><p>
	As a result, the code might also be a bit confusingly organized. There's
	quite a conflict between various goals there: On the one hand, I'd like to
	only have a single instance of every function shared with earlier games,
	as well as reduce ZUN's code duplication within a single game. On the
	other hand, this leads to quite a lot of code being scattered all over the
	place and then <code>#include</code>-pasted back together, except for the
	places where
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-07" "this doesn't work, and you'd have to use multiple translation units anyway"}}â€¦
	I'm only beginning to figure out the best structure here, and some more
	reverse-engineering attention surely won't hurt.
</p><p>
	Also, keep in mind that the code still targets x86 Real Mode. To work
	effectively in this codebase, you'd need some familiarity with
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation">memory
	segmentation</a>, and how to express it all in code. This tends to make
	even regular C++ development about an order of magnitude harder,
	especially once you want to interface with the remaining ASM code. That
	part made {{DB_CustomerByID 2}} struggle quite a bit with implementing his
	custom scripting language for the demo above. For now, he built that demo
	on quite a limited foundation â€“ which is why he also chose to release
	neither the build nor the source publically for the time being.<br />
	So yeah, you're definitely going to need the TASM and Borland C++ manuals
	there.
</p><p>
	tl;dr: We now know everything about this game's <i>data</i>, but not quite
	as much about this game's <i>code</i>.
</p><h5>So, how long until source ports become a realistic project?</h5><p>
	You <i>probably</i> want to wait for 100% RE, which is when everything
	that can be decompiled has been decompiled.
</p><p>
	Unless your target system is 16-bit Windows, in which case you could
	theoretically start right away. {{Blog_PostLink "2020-05-04" "Again"}},
	this would be the ideal first system to port PC-98 Touhou to: It would
	require all the generic portability work to remove the dependency on PC-98
	 hardware, thus paving the way for a subsequent port to modern systems,
	 yet you could still just drop in any undecompiled ASM.
</p><p>
	Porting to IBM-compatible DOS would only be a harder and less universally
	useful version of that. You'd then simply exchange one architecture, with
	its idiosyncrasies and limits, for another, with its own set of
	idiosyncrasies and limits. (Unless, of course, you already happen to be
	intimately familiar with that architecture.) The fact that master.lib
	provides DOS/V support would have only mattered if ZUN consistently used
	it to abstract away PC-98 hardware at every single place in the code,
	which is <i>definitely</i> not the case.
</p><hr /><p>
	The list of actually interesting findings in this push is,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-12-29" "again"}}, very short. Probably the most
	notable discovery: The low-level part of the code that renders Marisa's
	laser from her TH04 <i>Illusion Laser</i> shot type is still present in
	TH05. Insert wild mass guessing about potential beta version shot typesâ€¦
	Oh, and did you know that the order of background images in the Extra
	Stage staff roll differs by character?
</p><p>
	Next up: Finally driving up the RE% bar again, by decompiling some TH05
	main menu code.
