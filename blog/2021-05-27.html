	Alright, onto Konngara! Let's quickly move the escape sequences used later
	in the battle to C land, and then we can immediately decompile the loading
	and entrance animation function together with its filenames. Might as well
	reverse-engineer those escape sequences while I'm at it, though ‚Äì even if
	they aren't implemented in DOSBox-X, they're well documented in all those
	Japanese PDFs, so this should be no big deal‚Ä¶
</p><p>
	‚Ä¶wait, <kbd>ESC )3</kbd> switches to <i>"graph mode"</i>? As opposed to the
	default <i>"kanji mode"</i>, which can be re-entered via <kbd>ESC )0</kbd>?
	Let's look up graph mode in the <i>PC-9801 Programmers' Bible</i> then‚Ä¶
</p><blockquote>> Kanji cannot be handled in this mode.
</blockquote><p>
	‚Ä¶and that's apparently all it has to say. Why have it then, on a platform
	whose main selling point is a kanji ROM, and where Shift-JIS (and, well,
	7-bit ASCII) are the only native encodings? No support for graph mode in
	DOSBox-X either‚Ä¶ yeah, let's take a deep dive into NEC's
	<code>IO.SYS</code>, and get to the bottom of this.
</p><p>
	And yes, graph mode pretty much just disables Shift-JIS decoding for
	characters written via <code>INT 29h</code>, the lowest-level way of "just
	printing a <code>char</code>" on DOS, which every <code>printf()</code>
	will ultimately end up calling. Turns out there is a use for it though,
	which we can spot by looking at the 8√ó16 half-width section of font ROM:</p>

		src="{{$pic1}}"
		alt="8√ó16 half-width section of font ROM, with the characters in the Shift-JIS lead byte range highlighted in red"
	/></a></p><p>
	The half-width glyphs marked in <span style="color: red;">red</span>
	correspond to the byte ranges from 0x80-0x9F and 0xE0-0xFF‚Ä¶ which Shift-JIS
	defines as lead bytes for two-byte, full-width characters. But if we turn
	<i>off</i> Shift-JIS decoding‚Ä¶</p>
	<p class="gallery"><a href="{{$pic2}}"><img
		src="{{$pic2}}"
		alt="Visible differences between the kanji and graph modes on PC-98 DOS"
	/></a>
	</p><p class="gallery">
		<small>(Yes, that <code>g</code> in the function row is how NEC DOS
		indicates that graph mode is active. Try it yourself by pressing
		<kbd>Ctrl+F4</kbd>!)</small>
	</p><p>
	Jackpot, we get those half-width characters when printing their
	corresponding bytes.<br />
	<a href="https://github.com/joncampbell123/dosbox-x/pull/2547">I've
	re-implemented all my findings into DOSBox-X</a>, which will include graph
	mode in the upcoming 0.83.14 release. If P0140 looks a bit empty as a
	result, that's why ‚Äì most of the immediate feature work went into
	DOSBox-X, not into ReC98. That's the beauty of "anything" pushes.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}
</p><p>
	So, after switching to graph mode, TH01 does‚Ä¶ one of the slowest possible
	<code>memset()</code>s over all of text RAM ‚Äì one <code>printf(" ")</code>
	call for every single one of its 80√ó25 half-width cells ‚Äì before switching
	back to kanji mode. What a waste of RE time‚Ä¶? Oh well, at least we've now
	got plenty of proof that these weird escape sequences <i>actually</i> do
	nothing of interest.
</p><hr /><p>
	As for the Konngara code itself‚Ä¶ well, it's script-like code, what can you
	say. Maybe minimally sloppy in some places, but ultimately harmless.<br />
	One small thing that might not be widely known though: The large,
	blue-green Siddha·πÉ seed syllables are supposed to show up immediately, with
	no delay between them? Good to know. Clocking your emulator too low tends
	to roll them down from the top of the screen, and will certainly add a
	noticeable delay between the four individual images.
</p><p>
	‚Ä¶ Wait, but this means that ZUN could have <i>intended</i> this "effect".
	Why else would he not only put those syllables into four individual images
	(and therefore add at least the latency of disk I/O between them), but also
	show them on the foreground VRAM page, rather than on the "back buffer"?
</p><p>
	Meanwhile, in {{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-16" "another"}} instance of "maybe
	having gone too far in a few places":
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/08bc188e7dae7da9598f389d0bd8fa9da84db02d/th01/main/boss/b20j.cpp#L496">Expressing distances on the playfield as fractions of its width
	and height, just to avoid absolute numbers</a>? Raw numbers are bad because
	they're in screen space in this game. But we've already been throwing
	<code>PLAYFIELD_</code> constants into the mix as a way of explicitly
	communicating screen space, and keeping raw number literals for the actual
	playfield coordinates is looking increasingly sloppy‚Ä¶ I don't know,
	fractions really seemed like the most sensible thing to do with what we're
	given here. üòê
</p><hr /><p>
	So, 2 pushes in, and we've got the loading code, the entrance animation,
	facial expression rendering, and the first one out of Konngara's 12
	danmaku patterns. Might not sound like much, but since that first pattern
	involves those
	<img src="data:image/gif;base64,R0lGODlhCAAIAIABAACZqv///yH5BAEKAAEALAAAAAAIAAgAAAINjAGmiMv9okzSNRVuKAA7" alt="‚óÜ" />
	blue-green diamond sprites and therefore is one of the more complicated
	ones, it all amounts to roughly 21.6% of Konngara's code. That's 7 more
	pushes to get Konngara done, then? Next up though: Two pushes of website
	improvements.
