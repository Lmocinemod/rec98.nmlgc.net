	Alright, no more big code maintenance tasks that absolutely need to be
	done right now. Time to <i>really</i> focus on parts 6 and 7 of repaying
	technical debt, right? Except that we don't get to speed up just yet, as
	TH05's barely decompilable PMD file loading function is ratherâ€¦
	complicated.<br/>
	Fun fact: Whenever I see an unusual sequence of x86 instructions in PC-98
	Touhou, I first consult the disassembly of Wolfenstein 3D. That game was
	originally compiled with the quite similar Borland C++ 3.0, so it's quite
	helpful to compare its ASM to the
	<a href="https://github.com/id-Software/wolf3d">officially released source
	code</a>. If I find the instructions in question, they mostly come from
	that game's ASM code, leading to the amusing realization that "even John
	Carmack was unable to get these instructions out of this compiler"
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} This time though, Wolfenstein 3D did point me
	to Borland's intrinsics for common C functions like <code>memcpy()</code>
	and <code>strchr()</code>, available via <code>#pragma intrinsic</code>.
	Bu~t those unfortunately still generate worse code than what ZUN
	micro-optimized here. Commenting how these sequences of instructions
	<i>should</i> look in C is unfortunately all I could do here.<br />
	The conditional branches in this function <i>did</i> compile quite nicely
	though, clarifying the control flow, <i>and</i> clearly exposing a ZUN
	bug: TH05's <code>snd_load()</code> will hang in an infinite loop when
	trying to load a non-existing -86 BGM file (with a <code>.M2</code>
	extension) if the corresponding -26 BGM file (with a <code>.M</code>
	extension) doesn't exist either.
</p><p>
	Unsurprisingly, the PMD channel monitoring code in TH05's Music Room
	remains undecompilable outside the two most "high-level" initialization
	and rendering functions. And it's <i>not</i> because there's data in the
	middle of the code segment â€“ that would have actually been possible with
	some <code>#pragma</code>s to ensure that the data and code segments have
	the same name. As soon as the SI and DI registers are referenced
	<i>anywhere</i>, Turbo C++ insists on emitting prolog code to save these
	on the stack at the beginning of the function, and epilog code to restore
	them from there before returning.
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/7f971a0">Found that out in
	September 2019, and confirmed that there's no way around it.</a> All the
	small helper functions here are quite simply too optimized, throwing away
	any concern for such safety measures. ðŸ¤·<br />
	Oh well, the two functions that <i>were</i> decompilable at least indicate
	that I do try.
</p><hr /><p>
	Within that same 6th push though, we've finally reached the one function
	in TH05 that was blocking further progress in TH04, allowing that game
	to finally catch up with the others in terms of separated translation
	units. Feels good to finally delete more of those .ASM files we've
	decompiled a while agoâ€¦ finally!
</p><p>
	But since that was just getting started, the most satisfying development
	in both of these pushes actually came from some more experiments with
	macros and <code>inline</code> functions for near-ASM code. By adding
	"unused" dummy parameters for all relevant registers, the exact input
	registers are made more explicit, which might help future port authors who
	then <i>maybe</i> wouldn't have to look them up in an x86 instruction
	reference <i>quite</i> as often. At its best, this even allows us to
	declare certain functions with the <code>__fastcall</code> convention and
	expressing such parameter lists as regular C, with no additional
	pseudo-registers or macros required.<br />
	As for output registers, Turbo C++'s code generation turns out to be even
	more amazing than previously thought when it comes to returning
	pseudo-registers from <code>inline</code> functions. A nice example for
	how this can improve readability can be found in this piece of TH02 code
	for polling the PC-98 keyboard state using a BIOS interrupt:
</p><pre>inline uint8_t keygroup_sense(uint8_t group) {
	_AL = group;
	_AH = 0x04;
	geninterrupt(0x18);
	// This turns the output register of this BIOS call into the return value
	// of this function. Surprisingly enough, this does *not* naively generate
	// the `MOV AL, AH` instruction you might expect here!
	return _AH;
}

void input_sense(void)
{
	// As a result, this this assignment becomes `_AH = _AH`, which Turbo C++
	// never emits as such, giving us only the three instructions we need.
	_AH = keygroup_sense(8);

	// Whereas this one gives us the one additional `MOV BH, AH` instruction
	// we'd expect, and nothing more.
	_BH = keygroup_sense(7);

	// And now it's obvious what both of these registers contain, from just
	// the assignments above.
	if(_BH & K7_ARROW_UP || _AH & K8_NUM_8) {
		key_det |= INPUT_UP;
	}
	// [â€¦]
}</pre><p>
	I love it. No inline assembly, as close to idiomatic C code as something
	like this is going to get, yet still compiling into the minimum possible
	number of x86 instructions on even a 1994 compiler. This is how I keep
	this project interesting for myself during chores like these.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} We might have even reached peak
	<code>inline</code> already?
</p><p>
	And that's 65% of technical debt in the <code>SHARED</code> segment repaid
	so far. Next up: Two more of these, which might already complete that
	segment? Finally!
