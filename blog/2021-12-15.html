	The "bad" news first: Expanding to Stripe in order to support Google Pay
	requires bureaucratic effort that is not quite justified yet, and would only
	be worth it after the next price increase.
</p><p>
	Visualizing technical debt has definitely been overdue for a while though.
	With 1 of these 2 pushes being focused on this topic, it makes sense to
	summarize once again what "<a
	href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Technical_debt">technical debt</a>"
	means in the context of ReC98, as this info was previously kind of scattered
	over multiple blog posts. Mainly, it encompasses
</p><ul>
	<li>any ZUN-written code</li>
	<li>that we did name and reverse-engineer,</li>
	<li>but which we simply moved out into dedicated files that are then
	<code>#include</code>d back into the big .ASM translation units,</li>
	<li>without worrying about decompilation or proving undecompilability for
	now.</li>
</ul><p>
	<i>Technically</i> (ha), it would also include all of master.lib, which has
	always been compiled into the binaries in this way, and which will require
	quite a bit of dedicated effort to be moved out into a properly linkable
	library, once it's feasible. But this code has never been part of any
	progress metric â€“ in fact, <a href="/progress/re-baseline">0% RE</a> is
	defined as the total number of x86 instructions in the binary <i>minus</i>
	any library code. There is also no relation between instruction numbers and
	the time it will take to finalize master.lib code, let alone a precedent of
	how much it would cost.
</p><p>
	If we now want to express technical debt as a percentage, it's clear where
	the 100% point would be: when all RE'd code is also compiled in from a
	translation unit outside the big .ASM one. But where would 0% be? Logically,
	it would be the point where no reverse-engineered code has ever been moved
	out of the big translation units yet, and nothing has ever been decompiled.
	With these boundary points, this is what we get:
</p><p class="gallery"><a
	href="{{$pic1}}"><img src="{{$pic1}}" alt="Visualizing technical debt in terms of the total amount of instructions that could possibly be not finalized" /></a>
</p><p>
	Not too bad! So it's 6.22% of total RE that we will have to revisit at some
	point, concentrated mostly around TH04 and TH05 where it resulted from a
	focus on position independence. The prices also give an accurate impression
	of how much more work would be required there.
</p><p>
	But is that really the best visualization? After all, it requires an
	understanding of our definition of technical debt, so it's maybe not the
	most useful measurement to have on a front page. But how about subtracting
	those 6.22% from the number shown on the RE% bars? Then, we get this:
</p><p class="gallery"><a
	href="{{$pic2}}"><img src="{{$pic2}}" alt="Visualizing technical debt in terms of the absolute number of 'finalized' instructions per binary" /></a>
</p><p>
	Which is where we get to the good news: Twitter surprisingly helped me out
	in choosing one visualization over the other, <a
	href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1470109509699973125">voting
	7:2 in favor of the <i>Finalized</i> version</a>. While this one requires
	you to manually calculate <i>â‚¬&nbsp;finalized&nbsp;-&nbsp;â‚¬&nbsp;RE'd</i> to
	obtain the raw financial cost of technical debt, it clearly shows, for the
	first time, how far away we are from the main goal of fully decompiling all
	5 gamesâ€¦ at least to the extent it's possible.
</p><hr /><p>
	Now that the parser is looking at these recursively included .ASM files for
	the first time, it needed a small number of improvements to correctly handle
	the more advanced directives used there, which no automatic disassembler
	would ever emit. Turns out I've been counting some directives as
	instructions that never should have been, which is where the additional
	0.02% total RE came from.
</p><p>
	One more overcounting issue remains though. Some of the RE'd assembly slices
	included by multiple games contain different <code>if</code> branches for
	each game, like this:
</p><pre>; An example assembly file included by both TH04's and TH05's MAIN.EXE:
if (GAME eq 5)
	; (Code for TH05)
else
	; (Code for TH04)
endif</pre><p>
	Currently, the parser simply ignores <code>if</code>, <code>else</code>, and
	<code>endif</code>, leading to the combined code of all branches being
	counted for every game that includes such a file. This also affects the
	calculated speed, and is the reason why finalization seems to be slightly
	faster than reverse-engineering, at currently 471 instructions per push
	compared to 463. However, it's not that bad of a signal to send: Most of the
	not yet finalized code is shared between TH04 and TH05, so finalizing it
	will roughly be twice as fast as regular reverse-engineering to begin with.
	(Unless the code then turns out to be twice as complex than average codeâ€¦
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}).
</p><p>
	For completeness, finalization is now also shown as part of the <a
	href="/progress">per-commit metrics</a>. Now it's clearly visible what I was
	doing in those very slow five months between <a
	href="/progress/dc9e3ee47599dc02d737602c22a5bfa75eeaae34">P0131</a> and <a
	href="/progress/d9858113d8135d265b88e0325d40fc237e6b9763">P0140</a>, where
	the progress bar didn't move at all: Repaying 3.49% of previously
	accumulated technical debt across all games. ðŸ‘Œ
</p><hr /><p>
	As announced, I've also implemented a new caching system for this website,
	as the second main feature of these two pushes. By appending a hash string
	to the URLs of static resources, your browser should now both cache them
	forever <i>and</i> re-download them once they did change on the server. This
	avoids the unnecessary (and quite frankly, embarrassing) re-requests for all
	static resources that typically just return a <code>304 Not Modified</code>
	response. As a result, the blog should now load a bit faster on repeated
	visits, especially on slower connections. That should allow me to
	deliberately not paginate it for another few years, without it getting all
	<i>too</i> slow â€“ and should prepare us for the day when our first game
	reaches 100% and the server will get smashed. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
	However, I am open to changing the <i>progress blog</i> link in the
	navigation bar at the top to the <a href="/blog/tag">list of tags</a>, once
	people start complaining.
</p><p>
	Apart frome some more invisible correctness and QoL improvements, I've also
	prepared some new funding goals, but I'll cover those once the store
	reopens, next year. Syntax highlighting for code snippets would have also
	been cool, but unfortunately didn't make it into those two pushes. It's
	still on the list though!
</p><p>
	Next up: Back to RE with the TH03 score file format, and other code that
	surrounds it.
