	Whoops, the build was broken <i>again</i>? Since
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/7897bf1">P0127 from
	mid-November 2020</a>, on TASM32 version 5.3, which also happens to be the
	one in the DevKit… That version changed the alignment for the default
	segments of certain memory models when requesting <code>.386</code>
	support. And since redefining segment alignment apparently is highly
	illegal and absolutely has to be a build error, some of the stand-alone
	.ASM translation units didn't assemble anymore on this version. I've only
	spotted this on my own because I casually compiled ReC98 somewhere else –
	on my development system, I happened to have TASM32 version 5.0 in the
	<code>PATH</code> during all this time.<br />
	At least this was a good occasion to
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/8bcf5d7">get rid of some
	weird segment alignment workarounds from 2015, and replace them with the
	superior convention of using the <code>USE16</code> modifier for the
	<code>.MODEL</code> directive.</a>
</p><p>
	ReC98 would highly benefit from a build server – both in order to
	immediately spot issues like this one; even more so than the usual
	open-source project of its size, I would say. But that might be exactly
	<i>because</i> it doesn't seem like something you can trivially outsource
	to one of the big CI providers for open-source projects, and quickly set
	it up with a few lines of YAML.<br />
	That might still work in the beginning, and we might get by with a regular
	64-bit Windows 10 and DOSBox running the exact build tools from the DevKit.
	Ideally, though, such a server should really run the optimal configuration
	of a 32-bit Windows 10, allowing both the 32-bit and the 16-bit build step
	to run natively, which already is something that no popular CI service out
	there offers. Then, we'd optimally expand to Linux, every other Windows
	version down to 95, emulated PC-98 systems, other TASM versions… yeah, it'd
	be a lot. An experimental project all on its own, with additional hosting
	costs and probably diminishing returns, the more it expands…<br />
	I've added it as a category to the order form, let's see how much interest
	there is once the store reopens (which will be at the beginning of May, at
	the latest). That aside, it would {{Blog_PostLink "2020-07-12" "also"}} be
	a great project for outside contributors!
</p><hr /><p>
	So, technical debt, part 8… and right away, we're faced with TH03's
	low-level input function, which
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-16" "once"}}
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-01-06" "again"}}
	{{Blog_PostLink "2021-01-31" "insists"}} on being word-aligned in a way we
	can't fake without duplicating translation units.
	Being undecompilable isn't exactly the best property for a function that
	has been interesting to modders in the past: In 2018,
	<a href="https://twitter.com/spaztron64">spaztron64</a> created an
	ASM-level mod that hardcoded more ergonomic key bindings for human-vs-human
	multiplayer mode: {{HTML_Download .HostedPath $patch}}
	However, this remapping attempt remained quite limited, since we hadn't
	(and still haven't) reached full position independence for TH03 yet.
	There's quite some potential for size optimizations in this function, which
	would allow more BIOS key groups to already be used right now, but it's not
	all that obvious to modders who aren't intimately familiar with x86 ASM.
	Therefore, I <i>really</i> wouldn't want to keep such a long and important
	function in ASM if we don't <i>absolutely</i> have to…
</p><p>
	… and apparently, that's all the motivation I needed? So I took the risk,
	and spent the first half of this push on reverse-engineering
	<code>TCC.EXE</code>, to hopefully find a way to get word-aligned code
	segments out of Turbo C++ after all.
</p><p>
	And there is! The <code>-WX</code> option, used for creating
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DOS_Protected_Mode_Interface">DPMI
	</a> applications, messes up all sorts of code generation aspects in weird
	ways, but does in fact mark the code segment as word-aligned. We can
	consider ourselves quite lucky that we get to use Turbo C++ 4.0, because
	this feature isn't available in any previous version of Borland's C++
	compilers.<br />
	That allowed us to restore all the decompilations I previously threw away…
	well, two of the three, that lookup table generator was too much of a mess
	in C. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} But <i>what</i> an abuse this is. The
	subtly different code generation has basically required one creative
	workaround per usage of <code>-WX</code>. For example, enabling that option
	causes the regular <code>PUSH BP</code> and <code>POP BP</code> prolog and
	epilog instructions to be wrapped with <code>INC BP</code> and
	<code>DEC BP</code>, for some reason:
</p><pre>a_function_compiled_with_wx proc
	inc 	bp    	; ???
	push	bp
	mov 	bp, sp
	    	      	; [… function code …]
	pop 	bp
	dec 	bp    	; ???
	ret
a_function_compiled_with_wx endp</pre><p>
</p><p>
	Luckily again, all the functions that currently require <code>-WX</code>
	don't set up a stack frame and don't take any parameters.<br />
	While this hasn't <i>directly</i> been an issue so far, it's been pretty
	close: <code>snd_se_reset(void)</code> is one of the functions that require
	word alignment. Previously, it shared a translation unit with the
	immediately following <code>snd_se_play(int new_se)</code>, which does take
	a parameter, and therefore would have had its prolog and epilog code messed
	up by <code>-WX</code>.
	Since the latter function has a consistent (and thus, fakeable) alignment,
	I simply split that code segment into two, with a new <code>-WX</code>
	translation unit for just <code>snd_se_reset(void)</code>. Problem solved –
	after all, two C++ translation units are still better than 1 ASM
	translation unit. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Especially with all the
	previous <code>#include</code> improvements.
</p><p>
	The rest was more of the usual, getting us 74% done with repaying the
	technical debt in the <code>SHARED</code> segment. A lot of the remaining
	26% is TH04 needing to catch up with TH03 and TH05, which takes
	comparatively little time. With some good luck, we <i>might</i> get this
	done within the next push… that is, if we aren't confronted with all too
	many more disgusting decompilations, like the two functions that ended this
	push.
	If we are, we might be needing 10 pushes to complete this after all, but
	that piece of research was definitely worth the delay. Next up: One more of
	these.
