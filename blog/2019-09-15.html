	Here we go, new C code! …eh, it will still take a bit to really get
	decompilation going at the speeds I was hoping for. Especially with the
	sheer amount of <i>stuff</i> that is set in the first few significant
	functions we actually <i>can</i> decompile, which now all has to be
	correctly declared in the C world. Turns out I spent the last 2 years
	screwing up the case of exported functions, and even some of their names,
	so that it didn't actually reflect their calling convention… yup. That's
	just the stuff you tend to forget while it doesn't matter.
</p><p>
	To make up for that, I decided to research whether we can make use of some
	C++ features to improve code readability after all. Previously, it seemed
	that TH01 was the only game that included any C++ code, whereas TH02 and
	later seemed to be 100% C and ASM. However, during the development of the
	soon to be released new build system, I noticed that even this old
	compiler from the mid-90's, infamous for prioritizing compile speeds over
	all but the most trivial optimizations, was capable of quite surprising
	levels of automatic inlining with class methods…
</p><p>
	…leading the research to culminate in the mindblow that is
	{{git_CommitLink "9d121c7"}} – yes, we <i>can</i> use C++ class methods
	and operator overloading to make the code more readable, while still
	generating the same code than if we had just used C and preprocessor
	macros.
</p><p>
	Looks like there's now the potential for a few pull requests from outside
	devs that apply C++ features to improve the legibility of previously
	decompiled and terribly macro-ridden code. So, if anyone wants to help
	without spending money…
