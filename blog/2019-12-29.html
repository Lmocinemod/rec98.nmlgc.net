	ðŸŽ‰ TH04's and TH05's <tt>OP.EXE</tt> are now fully position-independent! ðŸŽ‰
</p><h5>What does this mean?</h5><p>
	You can now add any data or code to the main menus of the two games, by
	simply editing the ReC98 source, writing your mod in ASM or C/C++, and
	recompiling the code. Since all absolute memory addresses have now been
	converted to labels, this will work without causing any instability. See
	the <a href="/faq#pi-what">position independence section in the FAQ</a>
	for a more thorough explanation about why this was a problem.
</p><h5>What does this not mean?</h5><p>
	The original ZUN code hasn't been completely reverse-engineered yet, let
	alone decompiled. Pretty much all of that is still ASM, which might make
	modding a bit inconvenient right now.

	Since this push was otherwise pretty unremarkable, I made a video
	demonstrating a few basic things you can do with this:
	<a href="#2019-12-19-consent" id="2019-12-19-consent" onclick="enableExternal('2019-12-19-consent', '2019-12-19-video', function(iframe) {iframe.src= 'https://www.youtube.com/embed/iqPxiaaHIhA';}); return false;">
	(click to enable external content from YouTube)</a>

	<iframe id="2019-12-19-video" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</p>
<p>
	Now, what to do for the last outstanding {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} push?
	Bullets, or resident structures? {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
