	ðŸŽ‰ TH04's and TH05's <code>OP.EXE</code> are now fully
	position-independent! ðŸŽ‰

	You can now add any data or code to the main menus of the two games, by
	simply editing the ReC98 source, writing your mod in ASM or C/C++, and
	recompiling the code. Since all absolute memory addresses have now been
	converted to labels, this will work without causing any instability. See
	the <a href="/faq#pi-what">position independence section in the FAQ</a>
	for a more thorough explanation about why this was a problem.
</p><h5>What does this not mean?</h5><p>
	The original ZUN code hasn't been completely reverse-engineered yet, let
	alone decompiled. Pretty much all of that is still ASM, which might make
	modding a bit inconvenient right now.

	Since this push was otherwise pretty unremarkable, I made a video
	demonstrating a few basic things you can do with this:
	<script>externalRegister('2019-12-29', 'vid', 'https://youtube.com/embed/iqPxiaaHIhA');</script>
</p><p class="gallery">
	<iframe id="2019-12-29-vid" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	Now, what to do for the last outstanding {{DB_CustomerByID 9}} push?
	Bullets, or resident structures? {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
