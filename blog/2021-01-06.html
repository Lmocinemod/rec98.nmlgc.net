	Now <i>that's</i> the amount of translation unit separation progress I was
	looking for! Too bad that RL is keeping me more and more occupied these
	days, and ended up delaying this push until 2021. Now that
	{{DB_CustomerByID 9}} is also commissioning me to update their
	infrastructure, it's going to take a while for ReC98 to return to full
	speed, and for the store to be reopened. Should happen by April at the
	latest, though!
</p><p>
	With everything related to this separation of translation units explained
	earlier, we've <i>really</i> got a push with nothing to talk about, this
	time. Except, maybe, for the realization that
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-07" "this current approach"}} might not be the
	best fit for TH02 after all: Not only did it force us to
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-16" "throw away the previous decompilation"}} of
	the sound effect playback functions, but <code>OP.EXE</code> also contains
	obviously copy-pasted code <i>in addition</i> to the common, shared set of
	library functions. How was that game even <i>built</i>, originally??? No
	way around compiling that one instance of the <i>"delay until given BGM
	measure"</i> function separately then, if it insists on using its own
	instance of the VSync delay functionâ€¦<br />
	Oh well, this separated layout still works better for the later games, and
	consistency is good. Smooth sailing with all of the other functions, at
	least.
</p><p>
	Next up: One more of these, which might even end up completing the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-11-03" "transition to our own master.lib header file"}}.
	In terms of the total number of ASM code left in the <code>SHARED</code>
	code segments, we're now 30% done after 3 dedicated pushes. It really
	shouldn't require 7 more pushes, though!
