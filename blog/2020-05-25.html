	Three pushes to decompile the TH01 high score menu… because it's
	completely terrible, and needlessly complicated in pretty much every
	aspect:
</p><ul>
	<li>Another, final set of differences between the <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>
	and <code>FUUIN.EXE</code> versions of the code. Which are so
	insignificant that it <i>must</i> mean that ZUN kept this code in two
	separate, manually and imperfectly synced files. The <code>REIIDEN.EXE
	</code> version, only shown when game-overing, automatically jumps to the
	enter/<span lang="ja">終</span> button after the 8th character was entered,
	and also has a completely invisible timeout that force-enters a high score
	name after 1000… <i>key presses</i>? Not frames? Why. Like, how do you
	even realistically such a number. (Best guess: It's a hidden easter egg to
	amuse players who place drinking glasses on cursor keys. Or beer bottles.)
	<br />
	That's all the differences that are <i>maybe</i> visible if you squint
	hard enough. On top of that though, we got a bunch of further, minor code
	organization differences that serve no purpose other than to waste
	decompilation time, and certainly did their part in stretching this out to
	3 pushes instead of 2.</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>Entered names are restricted to a set of 16-bit, full-width Shift-JIS
	codepoints, yet are still accessed as 8-bit byte arrays everywhere. This
	bloats both the C++ and generated ASM code with needless byte splits,
	swaps, and bit shifts. Same for the route kanji. You have this 16-, heck,
	even 32-bit CPU, why not use it?! (Fun fact: <code>FUUIN.EXE</code> is
	explicitly compiled for a 80186, for the most part – unlike <code>
	REIIDEN.EXE</code>, which <i>does</i> use Turbo C++'s 80386 mode.)</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>The sensible way of storing the current position of the alphabet
	cursor would simply be two variables, indicating the logical row and
	column inside the character map. When rendering, you'd then transform
	these into screen space. This can keep the on-screen position constants in
	a single place of code.<br />
	TH01 does the opposite: The selected character is stored directly in terms
	of its on-screen position, which is then mapped <i>back</i> to a character
	index for every processed input and the subsequent screen update. There's
	no notion of a logical row or column anywhere, and consequently, the
	position constants are vomited all over the code.</li>
</ul><ul>
	<li>Which might not be <i>as</i> bad if the character map had a uniform
	grid structure, with no gaps. But the one in TH01 looks like this:
	<p class="gallery"><a
href="{{$pic1}}"><img src="{{$pic1}}" alt="TH01 high score name character map" /></a></p
>
	And with no sense of abstraction anywhere, both input handling and
	rendering end up with a separate <code>if</code> branch for at least 4 of
	the 6 rows.</li>
</ul><p>
	In the end, I just gave up with my usual redundancy reduction efforts for
	this one. Anyone wanting to change TH01's high score name entering code
	would be better off just rewriting the entire thing properly.
</p><p>
	And that's all of the shared code in TH01! Both <code>OP.EXE</code> and
	<code>FUUIN.EXE</code> are now only missing the actual main menu and
	ending code, respectively. Next up, though: The long awaited TH01 PI push.
	Which will not only deliver 100% PI for <code>OP.EXE</code> and <code>
	FUUIN.EXE</code>, but also probably <i>quite</i> some gains in <code>
	REIIDEN.EXE</code>. With now over 30% of the game decompiled, it's about
	time we get to look at some gameplay code!
