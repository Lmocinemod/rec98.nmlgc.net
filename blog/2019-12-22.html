	Big gains, as expected, but not much to say about this one. With TH05 Reimu
	being <i>way</i> too easy to decompile after
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-10-14" "the shot control groundwork done in October"}},
	there was enough time to give the comprehensive PI false-positive
	treatment to two other sets of functions present in TH04's and TH05's
	<tt>OP.EXE</tt>. One of them, master.lib's <tt>super_*()</tt> functions,
	was used <i>a lot</i> in TH02, more than in any other game… I wonder how
	much more that game will progress without even focusing on it in
	particular.

	Alright then! 100% PI for TH04's and TH05's <tt>OP.EXE</tt> upcoming…
