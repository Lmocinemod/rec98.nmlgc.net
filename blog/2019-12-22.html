	Big gains, as expected, but not much to say about this one. With TH05 Reimu
	being <i>way</i> too easy to decompile after
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-10-14" "the shot control groundwork done in October"}},
	there was enough time to give the comprehensive PI false-positive
	treatment to two other sets of functions present in TH04's and TH05's
	<code>OP.EXE</code>. One of them, master.lib's <code>super_*()</code>
	functions, was used <i>a lot</i> in TH02, more than in any other game… I
	wonder how much more that game will progress without even focusing on it
	in particular.

	Alright then! 100% PI for TH04's and TH05's <code>OP.EXE</code> upcoming…
	(<b><i>Edit:</i></b> Already got funding to cover this!)
