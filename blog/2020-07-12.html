	Well, make that three days. Trying to figure out all the details behind
	the sprite flickering was absolutely dreadful‚Ä¶<br />
	It started out easy enough, though. Unsurprisingly, TH01 had a quite
	limited pellet system compared to TH04 and TH05:
</p><ul>
	<li>The cap is 100, rather than 240 in TH04 or 180 in TH05.</li>
	<li>Only 6 special motion functions (with one of them broken and unused)
	instead of 10. This is where you find the code that generates SinGyoku's
	chase pellets, Kikuri's small spinning multi-pellet circles, and
	Konngara's rain pellets that bounce down from the top of the playfield.
	</li>
	<li>A tiny selection of preconfigured multi-pellet groups. Rather than
	TH04's and TH05's freely configurable n-way spreads, stacks, and rings,
	TH01 only provides abstractions for 2-, 3-, 4-, and 5- way spreads (yup,
	no 6-way or beyond), with a fixed narrow or wide angle between the
	individual pellets. The resulting pellets are also hardcoded to linear
	motion, and can't use the special motion functions. Maybe not the best
	code, but still kind of cute, since the generated groups do follow a
	clear logic.</li>
</ul><p>
	As expected from TH01, the code comes with its fair share of smaller,
	insignificant ZUN bugs and oversights. As you would <i>also</i> expect
	though, the sprite flickering points to the biggest and most consequential
	flaw in all of this.
</p><hr /><p>
	Apparently, it started with ZUN getting the impression that it's only
	possible to use the PC-98 EGC for fast blitting of all 4 bitplanes in one
	CPU instruction if you blit 16 horizontal pixels (= 2 bytes) at a time.
	Consequently, he only wrote one function for EGC-accelerated sprite
	unblitting, which can only operate on a "grid" of 16√ó1 tiles in VRAM. But
	wait, pellets are not only just 8√ó8, but can also be placed at any
	unaligned X position‚Ä¶
</p><p>
	‚Ä¶ yet the game still insists on using this 16-dot-aligned function to
	unblit pellets, forcing itself into using a super sloppy 16√ó8 rectangle
	for the job. ü§¶ ZUN then tried to mitigate the resulting flickering in two
	hilarious ways that just make it worse:
</p><ol>
	<li>An‚Ä¶ "interlaced rendering" mode? This one's activated for all Stage 15
	and 20 fights, and separates pellets into two halves that are rendered on
	alternating frames. Collision detection with the Yin-Yang Orb and the
	player is only done for the visible half, but collision detection with
	player <i>shots</i> is still done for all pellets every frame, as are
	motion updates ‚Äì so that pellets don't end up moving half as fast as they
	should.<br />
	So yeah, your eyes weren't deceiving you. The game <i>does</i> effectively
	drop its perceived frame rate in the Elis, Kikuri, Sariel, and Konngara
	fights, and it does so deliberately.</li>
	<li><p>
		{{Blog_PostLink "2020-06-13" "Just like player shots"}}, pellets
		are <i>also</i> unblitted, moved, and rendered in a single function.
		Thanks to the 16√ó8 rectangle, there's now the (completely unnecessary)
		possibility of accidentally unblitting parts of a sprite that was
		previously drawn into the 8 pixels right of a pellet. And <i>this</i>
		is where ZUN went full {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} and went "oh, I
		know, let's test the entire 16 pixels, and in case we got an entity
		there, we simply make the <i>pellet</i> invisible for this frame! Then
		we don't even have to unblit it later!" {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}}
	</p><p>
		Except that this is only done for the first 3 elements of the player
		shot array‚Ä¶?! Which don't even necessarily have to contain the 3 shots
		fired last. It's not done for the player sprite, the Orb, or, heck,
		<i>other pellets</i> that come earlier in the pellet array. (At least
		we avoided going ùëÇ(ùëõ¬≤) there?)
	</p><p>
		Actually, and I'm only realizing this now as I type this blog post:
		This test is done <i>even if the shots at those array elements aren't
		active</i>. So, pellets tend to be made invisible based on comparisons
		with garbage data. {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
	</p><p>
		And <i>then</i> you notice that the <i>player shot</i>
		unblit‚Äã/‚Äãmove‚Äã/‚Äãrender function is actually only ever called from the
		<i>pellet</i> unblit‚Äã/‚Äãmove‚Äã/‚Äãrender function on the one global instance
		of the player shot manager class, after pellets were unblitted. So, we
		end up with a sequence of
	</p><blockquote>Pellet unblit ‚Üí Pellet move ‚Üí Shot unblit ‚Üí Shot move ‚Üí Shot render ‚Üí Pellet render</blockquote><p>
		which means that <i>we can't ever unblit a previously rendered shot
		with a pellet</i>. Sure, as terrible as this one function call is from
		a software architecture perspective, it was enough to fix this issue.
		Yet we don't even get the intended positive effect, and walk away with
		pellets that are made temporarily invisible for no reason at all. So,
		uh, maybe it all just <i>was</i> an attempt at increasing the
		ramerate on lower spec PC-98 models?

</ol><p>
	Yup, that's it, we've found the most stupid piece of code in this game,
	period. It'll be hard to top this.
</p><hr /><p>
	I'm confident that it's possible to turn TH01 into a well-written, fluid
	PC-98 game, with no flickering, and no perceived lag, once it's
	position-independent. With some more in-depth knowledge and documentation
	on the EGC (remember, there's still
	{{Blog_PostLink "2019-11-06" "this one TH03 push waiting to be funded"}}),
	you might even be able to continue using that piece of blitter hardware.
	And no, you certainly won't need ASM micro-optimizations ‚Äì just a bit of
	knowledge about which optimizations Turbo C++ does on its own, and what
	you'd have to improve in your own code. It'd be very hard to <i>write</i>
	worse code than what you find in TH01 itself.
</p><p>
	(<s><a href="https://godbolt.org">Godbolt</a> for Turbo C++ 4.0J when?</s>
	Seriously though, that would {{Blog_PostLink "2020-07-09" "also"}} be a
	great project for outside contributors!)
</p><hr /><p>
	Oh well. In contrast to TH04 and TH05, where 4 pushes only covered all the
	involved data types, they were enough to completely cover <i> all</i> of
	the pellet code in TH01. Everything's already decompiled, and we never
	have to look at it again. üòå And with that, TH01 has also gone from by far
	the least RE'd to the most RE'd game within ReC98, in just half a year! üéâ
	<br />
	Still, that was enough TH01 game logic for a while.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} Next up: Making up for the delay with some
	more relaxing and easy pieces of TH01 code, that hopefully make just a
	<i>bit</i> more sense than all this garbage. More image formats, mainly.
