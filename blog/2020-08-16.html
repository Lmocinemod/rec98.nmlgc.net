	Back to TH05! Thanks to the good funding situation, I can strike a nice
	balance between getting TH05 position-independent as quickly as possible,
	and properly reverse-engineering some missing important parts of the game.
	Once 100% PI will get the attention of modders, the code will then be in
	better shape, and a bit more usable than if I just rushed that goal.
</p><p>
	By now, I'm apparently also pretty spoiled by TH01's immediate
	decompilability, after having worked on that game for so long.
	Reverse-engineering in ASM land <i>is</i> pretty annoying, after all,
	since it basically boils down to meticulously editing a piece of ASM into
	something I can confidently call <i>"reverse-engineered"</i>. Most of the
	time, simply decompiling that piece of code would take just a little bit
	longer, but be massively more useful. So, I immediately tried decompiling
	with TH05â€¦ and it just worked, at every place I tried!? Whatever the issue
	was that made {{Blog_PostLink "2019-09-21" "segment splitting"}} so
	annoying at my first attempt, I seem to have completely solved it in the
	meantime. ðŸ¤· So yeah, backers can now request pretty much any part of TH04
	and TH05 to be decompiled immediately, with no additional segment
	splitting cost.
</p><p>
	(Protip for everyone interested in starting their own ReC project: Just
	declare one segment per function, right from the start, then group them
	together to restore the original code segmentationâ€¦)
</p><hr /><p>
	Except that TH05 then just throws more of its infamous micro-optimized and
	undecompilable ASM at you. ðŸ™„ This push covered the function that adjusts
	the bullet group template based on rank and the selected difficulty,
	called every time such a group is configured. Which, just like pretty
	much all of TH05's bullet spawning code, is one of those undecompilable
	functions. If C allowed labels of other functions as <code>goto</code>
	targets, it <i>might</i> have been decompilable into something useful to
	moddersâ€¦ maybe. But like this, there's no point in even trying.
</p><p>
	This is such a terrible idea from a software architecture point of view, I
	can't even. Because now, you suddenly <i>have</i> to mirror your C++
	declarations in ASM land, and keep them in sync with each other. I'm
	always happy when I get to delete an ASM declaration from the codebase
	once I've decompiled all the instances where it was referenced. But for
	TH05, we now have to keep those declarations around forever. ðŸ˜• And all
	that for a performance increase you probably couldn't even measure. Oh
	well, pulling off Galaxy Brain-level ASM optimizations <i>is</i> kind of
	fun if you don't have portability plansâ€¦ I guess?
</p><p>
	If I started a full fangame mod of a PC-98 Touhou game, I'd base it on
	TH04 rather than TH05, and backport selected features from TH05 as
	needed. Just because it was released later doesn't make it better, and
	this is by far not the only one of ZUN's micro-optimizations that just
	went way too far.
</p><p>
	Dropping down to ASM also makes it easier to introduce weird quirks.
	Decompiled, one of TH05's tuning conditions for
	<a href="https://sparen.github.io/ph3tutorials/ddsga3.html#sub5">stack
	groups</a> on Easy Mode would look something like:
</p><pre>case BP_STACK:
	// [â€¦]
	if(spread_angle_delta >= 2) {
		stack_bullet_count--;
	}</pre><p>
	The fields of the bullet group template aren't typically reset when
	setting up a new group. So, <code>spread_angle_delta</code> in the context
	of a <i>stack</i> group effectively refers to "the delta angle of the last
	<i>spread</i> group that was fired before this stack â€“ whenever that was".
	uth05win also spotted this quirk, considered it a bug, and wrote
	fanfiction by changing <code>spread_angle_delta</code> to
	<code>stack_bullet_count</code>.<br />
	As usual for functions that occur in more than one game, I also decompiled
	the TH04 bullet group tuning function, and it's perfectly sane, with no
	such quirks.
</p><hr /><p>
	In the more PI-focused parts of this push, we got the TH05-exclusive
	smooth boss movement functions, for flying randomly or towards a given
	point. Pretty unspectacular for the most part, but we've got yet another
	uth05win inconsistency in the latter one. Once the Y coordinate gets close
	enough to the target point, it actually speeds up twice as much as the
	X coordinate would, whereas uth05win used the same speedup factors for
	both. This might make uth05win a couple of frames slower in all boss
	fights from Stage 3 on. Hard to measure though â€“ and boss movement partly
	depends on RNG anyway.
</p><hr /><p>
	Next up: Shinki's background animations â€“ which are actually the single
	biggest source of position dependence left in TH05.
