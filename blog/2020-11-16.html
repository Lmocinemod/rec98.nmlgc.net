	Alright, back to continuing the <code>master.hpp</code> transition started
	in P0124, and repaying technical debt. The last blog post already
	announced some ridiculous decompilationsâ€¦ and in fact, <i>not a single
	one</i> of the functions in these two pushes was decompilable into
	idiomatic C/C++ code.
</p><p>
	As usual, that didn't keep me from trying though. The TH04 and TH05
	version of the infamous <i>16-pixel-aligned, EGC-accelerated rectangle
	blitting function from page 1 to page 0</i> was fairly average as far as
	unreasonable decompilations are concerned.<br />
	The big blocker in TH03's <code>MAIN.EXE</code>, however, turned out to be
	the .MRS functions, used to render the gauge attack portraits and bomb
	backgrounds. The blitting code there uses the additional FS and GS segment
	registers provided by the Intel 386â€¦ which
</p><ol>
	<li>are not supported by Turbo C++'s inline assembler, and</li>
	<li>can't be turned into pointers, due to a compiler bug in Turbo C++ that
	generates wrong segment prefix opcodes for the <code>_FS</code> and
	<code>_GS</code> pseudo-registers.</li>
</ol><p>
	Apparently I'm the first one to even try doing that with this compiler? I
	haven't found any other mention of this bugâ€¦<br />
	Compiling via assembly (<code>#pragma inline</code>) would work around
	this bug and generate the correct instructions. But that would incur yet
	another dependency on a 16-bit TASM, for something honestly quite
	insignificant.
</p><p>
	What we can always do, however, is using <code>__emit__()</code> to simply
	output x86 opcodes anywhere in a function. Unlike spelled-out inline
	assembly, that can even be used in helper functions that are supposed to
	inlineâ€¦ which does in fact allow us to fully abstract away this compiler
	bug. Regular <code>if()</code> comparisons with pseudo-registers
	<i>wouldn't</i> inline, but "converting" them into C++ template function
	specializations <i>does</i>. All that's left is some C preprocessor abuse
	to turn the pseudo-registers into types, and then we <i>do</i> retain a
	normal-looking <code>poke()</code> call in the blitting functions in the
	end. ðŸ¤¯
</p><p>
	Yeahâ€¦ the result is
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/8b0165738a1fd66">batshit</a>
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/00e65f4c6b33eeb">insane.</a>
	I may have gone too far in a few placesâ€¦<br />
</p><hr /><p>
	One might certainly argue that all these ridiculous decompilations
	actually hurt the preservation angle of this project. <i>"Clearly, ZUN
	couldn't have <strong>possibly</strong> written such unreasonable C++ code.
	So why pretend he did, and not just keep it all in its more natural ASM
	form?"</i> Well, there are several reasons:
</p><ul>
	<li>Future port authors will merely have to translate all the
	pseudo-registers and inline assembly to C++. For the former, this is
	typically as easy as replacing them with newly declared local variables. No
	need to bother with function prolog and epilog code, calling conventions, or
	the build system.</li>
	<li>No duplication of constants and structures in ASM land.</li>
	<li>As a more expressive language, C++ can document the code much better.
	Meticulous documentation seems to have become the main attraction of ReC98
	these days â€“ I've seen it appreciated quite a number of times, and the
	continued financial support of all the backers speaks volumes. Mods, on the
	other hand, are still a rather rare sight.</li>
	<li>Having as few .ASM files in the source tree as possible looks better to
	casual visitors who just look at GitHub's repo language breakdown. This way,
	ReC98 will also turn from an <i>"Assembly project"</i> to its rightful state
	of <i>"C++ project"</i> much sooner.</li>
	<li>And finally, it's not like the ASM versions are
	<i>gone</i>&nbsp;â€“ they're still part of the Git history.</li>
</ul><p>
	Unfortunately, these pushes also demonstrated a second disadvantage in
	trying to decompile everything possible: Since Turbo C++ lacks TASM's
	fine-grained ability to enforce code alignment on certain multiples of
	bytes, it might actually be unfeasible to link in a C-compiled object file
	at its intended original position in some of the .EXE files it's used in.
	Whichâ€¦ you're only going to notice once you encounter such a case. Due to
	the slightly jumbled order of functions in the
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-09-07" "second, shared code segment"}}, that might
	be long after you decompiled and successfully linked in the function
	everywhere else.
</p><p>
	And then you'll have to throw away that decompilation after all ðŸ˜• Oh
	well. In this specific case (the lookup table generator for horizontally
	flipping images), that decompilation was a mess anyway, and probably
	helped nobody. I could have added a dummy .OBJ that does nothing but
	enforce the needed 2-byte alignment before the function if I
	<i>really</i> insisted on keeping the C version, but it really wasn't
	worth it.
</p><hr /><p>
	Now that I've also described yet another meta-issue, maybe there'll
	<i>really</i> be nothing to say about the next technical debt pushes?
	{{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}} Next up though: Back to actual progress
	again, with TH01. Which maybe even ends up pushing that game over the 50%
	RE mark?
