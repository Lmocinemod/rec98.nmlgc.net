	â€¦ nope, with a game whose <tt>MAIN.EXE</tt> is still just 5%
	reverse-engineered <i>and</i> which naturally makes heavy use of
	structures, there's still a lot more PI groundwork to be done before RE
	progress can speed up to the levels that we've now reached with TH05. The
	good news is that this game is (now) way easier to understand: In contrast
	to TH04 and TH05, where we needed to work towards player shots over a
	two-digit number of pushes, TH03 only needed two for SPRITE16, and a half
	one for the playfield shaking mechanism. After that, I could even already
	decompile the per-frame shot update and render functions, thanks to TH03's
	high number of code segments. Now, even the big 128-byte player structure
	doesn't seem all too far off.

	Then again, as TH03 shares no code with any other game, this actually was
	a completely average PI push. For the remaining three, we'll return to
	TH04 and TH05 though, which should more than make up for the slight drop
	in RE speed after this one.
</p><p>
	In other news, we've now also reached peak C++, with the introduction of
	<code>template</code>s! TH03 stores movement speeds in a 4.4 fixed-point
	format, which is an 8-bit spin on the usual 16-bit, 12.4 fixed-point
	format.
