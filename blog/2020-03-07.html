	Sadly, we've already reached the end of fast triple-speed TH01 progress
	with {{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-03" "the last push"}}, which decompiled the
	last segment shared by all three of TH01's executables. There's still a
	bit of double-speed progress left though, with a small number of code
	segments that are shared between just two of the three executables.
</p><p>
	At the end of the first one of these, we've got all the code for the .GRZ
	format – which is yet another run-length encoded image format, but this
	time storing up to 16 full 640×400 16-color images with an alpha bit. This
	one is exclusively used to wastefully store Konngara's sword slash and
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kuji-in">kuji-in</a> kill
	animations. Due to… suboptimal code organization, the code for the format
	is also present in <code>OP.EXE</code>, despite not being used there. But
	hey, that brings TH01 to over 20% in RE!
</p><p>
	Decoupling the RLE command stream from the pixel data sounds like a nice
	idea at first, allowing the format to efficiently encode a variety of
	animation frames displayed all over the screen… <i>if ZUN actually made
	use of it</i>. The RLE stream also has quite some ridiculous overhead,
	starting with 1 byte to store the 1-bit command (putting a single 8×1
	pixel block, or entering a run of N such blocks). Run commands then store
	another 1-byte run length, which has to be followed by <i>another</i>
	command byte to identify the run as putting N blocks, or skipping N blocks.
	And the pixel data is just a sequence of these blocks for all 4 bitplanes,
	in uncompressed form…
</p><p>
	Also, have some rips of all the images this format is used for:
</p><p class="gallery small">{{range loop 0 16 -}}
	{{- $pic := printf "boss8.grz-%1X.png" . -}}
	{{- $picFN := printf "%v%v" $prefix $pic -}}
	<a href="{{$picFN}}"><img
		src="{{$picFN}}"
		alt="<code>boss8.grz</code>, image {{inc .}}/16"
	/></a>
{{- end}}</p><p>
	To make these, I just wrote a small viewer, calling the same decompiled
	TH01 code: {{HTML_Download .HostedPath $grzview}}
	Obviously, this means that it not only must to be run on a PC-98, but also
	discards the alpha information.
	If any backers are <i>really</i> interested in having a proper converter
	to and from PNG, I can implement that in an upcoming push… although that
	would be <i>the</i> perfect thing for outside contributors to do.
</p><p>
	Next up, we got some code for the PI format… oh, wait, the actual files
	are called "GRP" in TH01.
