	So, let's finally look at some TH01 gameplay structures! The obvious
	choices here are player shots and pellets, which are conveniently located
	in the last code segment. Covering these would therefore also help in
	transferring some first bits of data in <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> from ASM
	land to C land. (Splitting the <i>data</i> segment would still be quite
	annoying.) Player shots are immediately at the beginningâ€¦
</p><p>
	â€¦but wait, these are drawn as transparent sprites loaded from .PTN files.
	Guess we first have to spend a push on
	{{Blog_PostLink "2020-03-13" "Part 2 of this format"}}.<br />
	Hm, 4 functions for alpha-masked blitting and unblitting of both 16Ã—16 and
	32Ã—32 .PTN sprites that align the X coordinate to a multiple of 8
	(remember, the PC-98 uses a
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Planar_(computer_graphics)">planar
	VRAM memory layout</a>, where 8 pixels correspond to a byte), but only one
	function that supports unaligned blitting to any X coordinate, and only
	for 16Ã—16 sprites? Which is only called twice? And doesn't come with a
	corresponding unblitting function? {{HTML_Emoji "thonk"}}
</p><p>
	Yeah, <i>"unblitting"</i>. TH01 isn't
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Double_buffering">double-buffered</a>,
	and uses the PC-98's second VRAM page exclusively to store a stage's
	background and static sprites. Since the PC-98 has no hardware sprites,
	all you can do is write pixels into VRAM, and any animated sprite needs to
	be manually removed from VRAM at the beginning of each frame. Not using
	double-buffering theoretically allows TH01 to simply copy back all 128 KB
	of VRAM once per frame to do this. {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} But that
	would be pretty wasteful, so TH01 just looks at all animated sprites, and
	selectively copies only their occupied pixels from the second to the first
	VRAM page.
</p><hr /><p>
	Alright, player shot class methodsâ€¦ oh, wait, the collision functions
	directly act on the Yin-Yang Orb, so we first have to spend a push on
	<i>that</i> one. And that's where the impression we got from the .PTN
	functions is confirmed: <i>The orb is, in fact, only ever displayed at
	byte-aligned X coordinates, divisible by 8.</i> It's only thanks to the
	constant spinning that its movement appears at least <i>somewhat</i>
	smooth.<br />
	This is purely a rendering issue; internally, its position <i>is</i>
	tracked at pixel precision. Sadly, smooth orb rendering at any unaligned X
	coordinate wouldn't be <i>that</i> trivial of a mod, because well, the
	necessary functions for unaligned blitting and unblitting of 32Ã—32 sprites
	don't exist in TH01's code. Then again, there's so much potential for
	optimization in this code, so it might be very possible to squeeze those
	additional two functions into the same C++ translation unit, even without
	position independenceâ€¦
</p><p>
	More importantly though, this was the right time to decompile the core
	functions controlling the orb physics â€“ probably the highlight in these
	three pushes for most people.<br />
	Well, "physics". The X velocity is restricted to the 5 discrete states of
	-8, -4, 0, 4, and 8, and gravity is applied by simply adding 1 to the Y
	velocity every 5 frames {{HTML_Emoji "zunpet"}} No wonder that this can
	easily lead to situations in which the orb infinitely bounces from the
	ground.<br />
	At least fangame authors now have
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/th01/main/player/orb.cpp">a
	reference of how ZUN did it originally</a>, because really, this bad
	approximation of physics had to have been written that way on purpose. But
	hey, it uses 64-bit floating-point variables! {{HTML_Emoji "onricdennat"}}
</p><p>
	â€¦sometimes at least, and quite randomly. This was also where I had to
	learn about Turbo C++'s floating-point code generation, and how rigorously
	it defines the order of instructions when mixing <code>double</code> and
	<code>float</code> variables in arithmetic or conditional expressions.
	This meant that I could only get ZUN's original instruction order by using
	literal constants instead of variables, which is impossible right now
	without somehow splitting the data segment. In the end, I had to resort to
	spelling out â…” of one function, and one conditional branch of another, in
	inline ASM. ðŸ˜• If ZUN had just written <code>16.0</code> instead of
	<code>16.0f</code> there, I would have saved quite some hours of my life
	trying to decompile this correctlyâ€¦
</p><p>
	To sort of make up for the slowdown in progress, here's the TH01 orb
	physics debug mod I made to properly understand them. <strong>Edit
	(2022-07-12): This mod is outdated,
	{{Blog_PostLink "2022-07-10" "the current version is here"}}!</strong>
	{{HTML_Download .HostedPath $patch}}
	To use it, simply replace <code>REIIDEN.EXE</code>, and run the game
	in debug mode, via <kbd>game d</kbd> on the DOS prompt.<br />
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/commit/874fe6db8a1a40f978b344ed7d400bbedd7ca0a3">
	Its code</a> might also serve as an example of how to achieve this sort of
	thing without position independence.

	Alright, <i>now</i> it's time for player shots though. Yeah, sure, they
	don't move horizontally, so it's not <i>too</i> bad that those are also
	always rendered at byte-aligned positions. But, uhâ€¦ why does this code
	only use the 16Ã—16 alpha-masked unblitting function for decaying shots,
	and just sloppily unblits an entire 16Ã—16 square everywhere else?
</p><p>
	The worst part though: Unblitting, moving, and rendering player shots <i>
	is done in a single function, in that order</i>. And that's exactly where
	TH01's sprite flickering comes from. Since different types of sprites are
	free to overlap each other, you'd have to first unblit all types, <i>then
	</i> move all types, and <i>then</i> render all types, as done in later
	PC-98 Touhou games. If you do these three steps per-type instead, you <i>
	will</i> unblit sprites of other types that have been rendered beforeâ€¦ and
	therefore end up with flicker.<br />
	Oh, and finally, ZUN also added an additional sloppy 16Ã—16 square unblit
	call if a shot collides with a pellet or a boss, for some <i>
	guaranteed</i> flicker. Sigh.
</p><hr /><p>
	And that's â…“ of all ZUN code in TH01 decompiled! Next up: Pellets!
