	Last part of TH01's main graphics function segment, and we've got even
	more code that alternates between being boring and being slightly weird.
	But at least, <i>"boring"</i> also meant <i>"consistent"</i> for once. And
	so progress continued to be as fast as expected from the last TH01 pushes,
	yielding 3.3% in TH01 RE%, and 1% in overall RE%, within a single day.
	There even was enough time to decompile another full code segment, which
	bundles all the hardware initialization and cleanup calls into single
	functions to be run when starting and exiting the game. Which might be
	interesting for at least one person, I guess {{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}}

	But seriously, trying to access page 2 on a system with only page 0 and 1?
	Had to get out my real PC-98 to double-check that I wasn't missing
	anything here, since every emulator only looks at the bottom bit of the
	page number. But real hardware seems to do the same, and there really is
	nothing special to it semantically, being equivalent to page 0. ðŸ¤·

	Next up in TH01, we'll have some file format code!
