	As expected, we've now got the TH04 and TH05 stage enemy structure,
	finishing position independence for all big entity types. This one was
	quite straightfoward, as the .STD scripting system is pretty simple.
</p><p>
	Its most interesting aspect can be found in the way timing is handled. In
	Windows Touhou, all .ECL script instructions come with a frame field that
	defines when they are executed. In TH04's and TH05's .STD scripts, on the
	other hand, it's up to each individual instruction to add a frame time
	parameter, anywhere in its parameter list. This frame time defines for how
	long this instruction should be repeatedly executed, before it manually
	advances the instruction pointer to the next one. From what I've seen so
	far, these instruction typically apply their effect on the first frame
	they run on, and then do nothing for the remaining frames.<br />
	Oh, and you can't nest the <code>LOOP</code> instruction, since the enemy
	structure only stores one single counter for the current loop iteration.
</p><p>
	Just from the structure, the only innovation introduced by TH05 seems to
	have been enemy subtypes. These can be used to parametrize scripts via
	conditional jumps based on this value, as a first attempt at cutting down
	the need to duplicate entire scripts for similar enemy behavior. And
	thanks to TH05's favorable segment layout, this game's version of the
	.STD enemy script interpreter is even immediately ready for decompilation,
	in one single future push.
</p><p>
	As far as I can tell, that now only leaves
</p><ul>
	<li>.MPN file loading</li>
	<li>player bomb animations</li>
	<li>some structures specific to the Shinki and EX-Alice battles</li>
	<li>plus some smaller things I've missed over the years</li>
</ul><p>
	until TH05's <code>MAIN.EXE</code> is completely position-independent.
	<br />
	Which, however, won't be all it needs for that 100% PI rating on the front
	page. And with that many false positives, it's quite easy to get lost with
	immediately reverse-engineering everything around them. This time, the
	rendering of the text dissolve circles, used for the stage and BGM title
	popups, caught my eye…  and since the high-level code to handle all of
	that was near the end of a segment in both TH04 and TH05, I just decided
	to immediately decompile it all. Like, how hard could it possibly be?
	Sure, it needed another segment split, which was a <i>bit</i> harder due
	to all the existing ASM referencing code in that segment, but certainly
	not impossible…
</p><p>
	Oh wait, this code depends on 9 other sets of identifiers that haven't
	been declared in C land before, some of which require vast reorganizations
	to bring them up to current consistency standards. Whoops! Good thing that
	this is the part of the project I'm still offering for free…<br>
	Among the referenced functions was <code>tiles_invalidate_around()</code>,
	which marks the stage background tiles within a rectangular area to be
	redrawn this frame. And this one must have had the hardest function
	signature to figure out in all of PC-98 Touhou, because <i>it actually
	seems impossible</i>. Looking at all the ways the game passes the center
	coordinate to this function, we have
</p><ol>
	<li>X and Y as 16-bit integer literals, merged into a single
	<code>PUSH</code> of a 32-bit immediate</li>
	<li>X and Y calculated and pushed independently from each other</li>
	<li>by-value copies of entire <code>Point</code> instances</li>
</ol><p>
	Any single declaration would only lead to at most two of the three cases
	generating the original instructions. No way around separately declaring
	the function in every translation unit then, with the correct parameter
	list for the respective calls. That's how ZUN must have also written it.
</p><p>
	Oh well, we would have needed to do all of this <i>some</i> time. At least
	there were quite a bit of insights to be gained from the actual
	decompilation, where using <code>const</code> references actually made it
	possible to turn quite a number of potentially ugly macros into wholesome
	<code>inline</code> functions.
</p><p>
	But still, TH04 and TH05 will come out of ReC98's decompilation as one big
	mess. A lot of further manual decompilation and refactoring, beyond the
	limits of the original binary, would be needed to make these games
	portable to any non-PC-98, non-x86 architecture.<br />
	And yes, that includes IBM-compatible DOS – which, for some reason, a
	number of people see as the obvious choice for a first system to port
	PC-98 Touhou to. This will barely be easier. Sure, you'll save the effort
	of decompiling all the remaining original ASM. But even <i>with</i>
	master.lib's <code>MASTER_DOSV</code> setting, these games still very much
	rely on PC-98 hardware, with corresponding assumptions all over ZUN's
	code. You <i>will</i> need to provide abstractions for the PC-98's
	superimposed text mode, the gaiji, and planar 4-bit color access in
	general, exchanging the use of the PC-98's GRCG and EGC blitter chips with
	something else. At that point, you might as well port the game to one
	generic 640×400 framebuffer and away from the constraints of DOS,
	resulting in that Doom source code-like situation which made <i>that</i>
	game easily portable to every architecture to begin with. But ZUN just
	wasn't a John Carmack, sorry.
</p><p>
	Or what do I know. I've never programmed for IBM-compatible DOS, but maybe
	ReC98's audience <i>does</i> include someone who is intimately familiar
	with IBM-compatible DOS so that the constraints aren't much of an issue
	for them? But even then, 16-bit Windows would make <i>much</i> more sense
	as a first porting target if you don't want to bother with that
	undecompilable ASM.
</p><p>
	At least I won't have to look at TH04 and TH05 for quite a while now.
	{{HTML_Emoji "tannedcirno"}} The delivery delays have made it obvious that
	my life has become pretty busy again, probably until September. With a
	total of 9 TH01 pushes from monthly subscriptions now waiting in the
	backlog, the shop will stay closed until I've caught up with most of
	these. Which I'm quite hyped for!
