<h2>FAQ</h2>
{{template "<q>" "what"}}
	What is this about?
</h3>
<p>
	For now, the aim is to perfectly reconstruct the lost<sup>[citation
	needed]</sup> source code of the first five
	<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Touhou_Project">Touhou Project</a>
	games by <i>ZUN Soft</i> (now <i>Team Shanghai Alice</i>), which were
	originally released exclusively for the NEC PC-9801 platform.
</p><p>
	The original games being:
</p><dl>
	<dt>TH01:</dt>
	<dd>
		<span lang="ja">Êù±ÊñπÈùàÁï∞‰ºù„ÄÄÔΩû </span>
		The Highly Responsive to Prayers (1997)
	</dd>
	<dt>TH02:</dt>
	<dd>
		<span lang="ja">Êù±ÊñπÂ∞ÅÈ≠îÈå≤„ÄÄÔΩû </span>
		the Story of Eastern Wonderland (1997)
	</dd>
	<dt>TH03:</dt>
	<dd>
		<span lang="ja">Êù±ÊñπÂ§¢ÊôÇÁ©∫„ÄÄÔΩû </span>
		Phantasmagoria of Dim.Dream (1997)
	</dd>
	<dt>TH04:</dt>
	<dd>
		<span lang="ja">Êù±ÊñπÂπªÊÉ≥ÈÉ∑„ÄÄÔΩû </span>
		Lotus Land Story (1998)
	</dd>
	<dt>TH05:</dt>
	<dd>
		<span lang="ja">Êù±ÊñπÊÄ™Á∂∫Ë´á„ÄÄÔΩû </span>
		Mystic Square (1998)
	</dd>
</dl><p>
	Since we only have the binaries, we obviously can't know how ZUN named any
	variables and functions, and which comments the original code was
	surrounded with. <i>Perfect</i> therefore means that the binaries compiled
	from the code in the <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98">ReC98
	repository</a> are <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/mzdiff">
	indistinguishable</a> from ZUN's original builds, making it impossible to
	<i>disprove</i> that the original code <i>couldn't</i> have looked like
	this. This property is maintained for every Git commit along the way.
</p><p>
	Aside from the preservation angle and the resulting deep insight into the
	games' mechanics, the code can then serve as the foundation for any type
	of mod, or any port to non-PC-98 platforms, developed by the community.

{{template "<q>" "who"}}Who are you?</h3>
<p>
	I created the <a href="https://github.com/thpatch/thcrap">Touhou Community
	Reliant Automatic Patcher</a> and <a href="https://thpatch.net">Touhou
	Patch Center</a> in 2012, and remained a core developer of both before
	retiring in March 2019. Older Touhou fans might also remember me for
	<i>Touhou Music Room</i> (2010/2011) and the <i>Touhou Vorbis
	Compressor</i> (2011).
</p><p>
	Check my <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc">GitHub page</a> as well as the
	<a href="/fundlog">crowdfunding log</a> here for more proof of my track
	record.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "three"}}
	What's the split between <code>OP</code>, <code>MAIN</code> and
	<code>MAINE</code>? What things are they responsible for? How do they
	interact with each other?
</h3>
<ul><li>
	<code>OP.EXE</code> contains the game's main menu and all other menus
	reachable from there. In TH04 and TH05, it also contains the <i>ZUN
	Soft</i> animation and the initial sound configuration menu. As a modder,
	you'd care about this file if you want to add anything involving new
	menus, like practice modes or a replay selection.
</li><li>
	As soon as you start the game, you're in <code>MAIN.EXE</code>
	(<code>REIIDEN.EXE</code> for TH01). As the biggest executable, it handles
	everything happening within a stage. Most notably, boss behavior ‚Äì unlike
	the Windows games, where this is stored in the separate
	<a href="https://en.touhouwiki.net/wiki/User:Mddass/Touhou_File_Format_Specification/ECL">
	ECL script files, found in the main <code>.dat</code> archive</a>.
</li><li>
	<code>MAINE.EXE</code> (<code>FUUIN.EXE</code> for TH01,
	<code>MAINL.EXE</code> for TH03) then contains code for the ending
	cutscenes, the staff roll, and anything after that. In TH03, it also
	contains the stage start and end screens with the character pictures, as
	well as the cutscenes before stages 8 and 9.
</li></ul><p>
	Since only one executable can be active at any given time, there has to be
	some way of sharing data between them. This is done using a resident
	<code>"Config"</code> structure, kept at the top of conventional DOS RAM.
	Currently, we're reverse-engineered the contents of this structure for
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/e0d90dbdc39941d775d5b38cbef33fd56522d846/th01/th01.h#L43">TH01</a>
	and <a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/aa56a7cb18881fbc602c0324b727c1578cac825e/th02/th02.h#L224">TH02</a>.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "position-independence"}}
	What is this "position independence" thing about?
</h3>
<p>
	Position <i>dependence</i> means that a binary's references to global
	variables are expressed as raw number constants, rather than being named
	with identifiers:
<pre>mov ax, some_data   ; Position-independent
mov ax, 1234h       ; Position-dependent; assumes that
                    ; [some_data] is at address 1234h
</pre>
	If you increase or decrease the number of bytes anywhere in the non-header
	parts of an executable, you'll end up breaking most of these
	position-dependent references, since global variables no longer are where
	the game expects them to be. This will lead to quite some instability.
</p><p>
	Now, why is this such an issue for PC-98 Touhou? 16-bit x86 code has to
	take <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X86_memory_segmentation">
	segmentation</a> into account for all its memory accesses. This means that
	each actual address is built out of two 16-bit values, the <i>segment</i>
	and the <i>offset</i>. Since offsets therefore can only range from 0 to
	2<sup>16</sup>-1, the line between actual memory offsets and numeric
	constants becomes blurred. Most disassemblers I know of that target this
	architecture therefore only do a very superficial attempt at identifying
	data references, and give up once arrays are involved, just leaving a
	numeric constant in place of such a reference. And for good reason: Doing
	this properly effectively requires an emulator, running the game and
	performing control flow analysis. Anything less than that ‚Äì
	<i>especially</i> anything parsing individual lines of ASM ‚Äì and you're
	bound to
</p><ul>
	<li>miss addresses that are <i>calculated</i> from other constants</li>
	<li>mistake function pointers for data pointers</li>
	<li>mistake pointers into special memory segments (graphics RAM, BIOS RAM,
	etc.) for data pointers</li>
	<li>or confuse <i>actual</i> numeric constants for memory addresses.
</ul><p>
	And even <i>with</i> an emulator, you're still faced with the fact that on
	the low level of ASM and C,
	<a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=i2fhNVQPb5I&t=43s">the declared
	size of an array is simply advisory anyway</a>. So what do you put,
	especially when being confronted with out-of-bounds array access bugs in
	the original game itself?
</p><p>
	So if you've chosen to deliver quality instead of delivering experimental
	research, the best choice is to give up, don't pretend to be
	position-independent in the first place, and treat <i>every</i> numeric
	constant that falls within the range of any data segment as a possible
	memory reference. Sure, this means that the <i>actual</i> number of memory
	references are lower, and thus, the actual percentage of
	position-independence is higher than the front page may suggest. But
	<i>we can't tell</i>, and erring on the side of caution is, in my opinion,
	better than pretending that the code is more position-independent than it
	actually is, just because it ran through some sort of experimental tool.
</p><p>
	While position-dependent code is still a significant step up from modding
	game binaries via hex-editing, it effectively still suffers from most of
	the same constraints, despite looking like regular source code that you
	can just arbitrarily edit and recompile. So while modding the game in all
	sorts of ways is definitely <i>possible</i> right now, it's definitely
	harder than it needs to be. Once a binary reaches 100% position
	independence though, developing any sort of mod, in either C/C++ or ASM,
	will become trivial.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "why"}}
	Why crowdfunding?
</h3>
<p>
	Personally, I gain nothing from this project ‚Äì neither in the
	fun/happiness domain, given that I don't particularly <i>like</i> Touhou
	these days, nor in the professional/employment prospect domain. At this
	rate, serving a weeb audience any longer with ever more elaborate projects
	won't get me anywhere else in life that it already doesn't get me in after
	having done it for so long. All things considered, most real-life IT
	companies I talked to don't see these past Touhou-related projects as
	anything particularly special. Lately, I've been getting the feeling that
	I should have just written them in COBOL ‚Äì now <i>that</i> would have
	certainly given me the reaction from RL I was hoping for!
</p><p>
	That leaves crowdfunding as an ethical way to balance the fandom's
	interest in this project with me getting old and slowly but surely wanting
	to have more of a RL.
</p><p>
	Another advantage is that it's <i>you</i>, the patrons, who decide which
	game to focus on. This is particularly relevant given that <i>I</i> don't
	really care which game I end up covering ‚Äì see above.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "automate"}}
	Can't a machine automate all this work? It all seems very blue-collar and
	mechanical.
</h3>
<p>
	Maybe. While it would have been an option to collect lots of money for
	developing an automated decompilation solution, that would have been a
	huge risk, and my previous attempts at it failed spectacularly. In
	contrast, selling small chunks of progress for an hourly wage leads to a
	stream of tiny, but immediate results. It may take longer in the end, but
	even partially reverse-engineered game code can be a tremendous help to
	modders. Also, naming variables, contextualizing numeric constants, and the
	resulting insights into the game mechanics, is something you simply can't
	get out of an automated solution.
</p><p>
	Consider this piece of ASM:
</p><pre>; Somewhere‚Ä¶
	mov	byte_2CEC2, 40

; Somewhere else‚Ä¶
	cmp	byte_25351, 0
	jz	@@return_from_function
	; ‚Ä¶
	cmp	byte_2CEC2, 0
	jz	@@down
	cmp	byte_2CEC2, 32
	jbe	@@return_from_function
	mov	byte_2CEC2, 0
	; ‚Ä¶
@@down:
	dec	byte_25351
</pre><p>
	Now, I could simply decompile this into
</p><pre>// Somewhere‚Ä¶
	byte_2CEC2 = 40;

// Somewhere else‚Ä¶
	if(byte_25351 == 0) {
		return;
	}
	; ‚Ä¶
	if(byte_2CEC2 != 0) {
		if(byte_2CEC2 <= 32) {
			return;
		}
		byte_2CEC2 = 0;
	}
	byte_25351--;
</pre><p>
	However, that doesn't really tell you anything that you couldn't already
	tell from looking at the assembly. After manually reverse-engineering
	the meaning of these variables, we learn that
</p><ul>
	<li><code>byte_2CEC2</code> is the <i>miss countdown</i> ‚Äì set to 40 if
	you collide with anything, playing an explosion animation while it's
	nonzero, then decremented each frame, and actually removing the life once
	it <i>reaches</i> zero</li>
	<li>and that <code>byte_25351</code> is the number of bombs in stock.</li>
</ul><p>
	And lo and behold, we just proved the existence of an 8-frame deathbomb
	window,
	<a href="https://twitter.com/ReC98Project/status/1176592461155713026">
	ending up with an insight that's immediately valuable to many fans</a>.
	Finally, let's define some symbols:
</p><pre>MISS_FRAMES = 32
DEATHBOMB_WINDOW = 8

; Somewhere‚Ä¶
	mov	_miss_time, MISS_FRAMES + DEATHBOMB_WINDOW

; Somewhere else‚Ä¶
	cmp	_bombs, 0
	jz	@@return_from_function
	; ‚Ä¶
	cmp	_miss_time, 0
	jz	@@down
	cmp	_miss_time, MISS_FRAMES
	jbe	@@return_from_function
	mov	_miss_time, 0
	; ‚Ä¶
@@down:
	dec	_bombs
</pre><p>
	And suddenly, it becomes both obvious <i>and easily moddable</i> to
	whoever reads the code, even while it's still assembly. <i>This is the
	level I operate at.</i> Decompilation only becomes mere syntactic sugar
	at this point.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "duration"}}
	How long is this crowdfunding campaign going to run?
</h3>
<p>
	Indefinitely ‚Äì and that's the beauty of it. Whenever someone is
	interested, they can insert a coin, and every {{HTML_PushPrice}} in the
	backlog will then be turned into tangible progress.
</p><p>
	Effectively, this project will run for as long as the market deems it
	valuable. Maybe we get enough to complete one game, maybe we won't. Maybe
	there will be no interest whatsoever for a few months, and then a small
	number of big transactions. Who knows.
</p><p>
	In a way, this is therefore closer to art commissions than it is to your
	typical video game crowdfunding campaign.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "dosbox-x"}}
	PC-98 emulation is getting better and better, DOSBox-X even has dynamic
	recompilation now. Are source ports of a single game series even worth it?
</h3>
<p>
	Again, you decide.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "uth05win"}}
	Isn't <a href="http://m.newsmth.net/article/TouHou/single/11992">
	uth05win</a> already what you wanted to achieve? We even have
	<a href="https://github.com/Wintiger0222/uth05win">source code</a> for it.
</h3>
<p>
	Initially, I thought the same, and had the impression that uth05win's
	source code release would immediately obsolete ReC98.
</p><p>
	However, while uth05win did indeed legitimately reverse-engineer most of
	TH05, the final port seems to have taken quite some liberties. I myself
	wouldn't know ‚Äì for me, uth05win is still a tremendous help in
	reverse-engineering not only TH05, but also TH04 and, to a lesser extent,
	even the  previous three games. Die-hard PC-98 Touhou fans, on the other
	hand, tend to immediately dismiss it as <i>"not the real thing"</i>.
	Which, ironically, led to ReC98's approach of a provably legit source code
	reconstruction being appreciated <i>more</i>, not less, among this group
	of people.
</p><p>
	Also, the obvious reason I don't restrict myself to just one game.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "identical-code"}}
	Why do pushes that are geared towards one specific game also tend to come
	with progress in other games? Aren't you wasting time there by not focusing
	100% on what your patrons wanted you to do?
</h3>
<p>
	If the same function appears in more than one game, more or less
	unchanged, I'd only be wasting time re-familiarizing myself with all the
	involved concepts months later. I think it makes more sense to immediately
	cover identical functionality in all games. It's basically free progress
	for everyone else.
</p><p>
	Then again, the more progress is made, the more infrequently this will
	happen, as the amount of not yet reverse-engineered code shared between
	the games approaches zero.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "refunds"}}
	Do you have a refund policy?
</h3>
<p>
	Yes! You can request refunds for every push I haven't started working on
	yet. I <i>will</i> keep the money after having delivered a push though.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "tsa-takedown"}}
	Can't Team Shanghai Alice take down this project and crowdfunding at any
	time?
</h3>
<p>
	While I can't promise that they <i>won't</i>, the same kind of source code
	reconstruction has been done for the
	<a href="https://github.com/pret/pokered#see-also">Generation I-III
	Pok√©mon games</a>, <a href="https://github.com/n64decomp/sm64">Super Mario
	64</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/diasurgical/devilution">Diablo</a>,
	all of which still generate revenue for their right holders.
</p><p>
	Keep in mind that <i>the product is the code, in the form of new commits
	in a Git repository</i>. Once again, I do <i>not</i> sell the promise of a
	finished Windows/Linux/phone port of any of the games.
</p><p>
	Perform a <code>git clone</code> after I pushed the commits you bought,
	and you now have a DRM-free digital copy of the progress you paid for.
	Nothing I produce will ever be put behind a paywall. The only thing that
	<i>is</i> behind a paywall is the time it takes to make it all happen.
</p><p>
	Also, consider this idea: Once the project is done, anyone can feel free
	to burn the reconstructed source code on a CD, and hand it to ZUN during
	some convention. Then, of course, ZUN has every right to commercially
	exploit it ‚Äì which would be fine by me, as I will have been paid my fair
	share at that point.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "pull-requests"}}
	Can I still help out with the reverse-engineering by contributing to the
	ReC98 repository?
</h3>
<p>
	Yes! As stated above, this is not about me making lots of profit. The
	community will certainly thank you for driving the total estimate further
	down.
</p><p>
	Although I'd really recommend you to <i>please</i> spend your time on a
	different project, which will bring you further in life that anything
	related to the main Touhou series ever will.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "cap-why"}}
	Why a cap?
</h3>
<p>
	The cap corresponds to the maximum time I can healthily allocate to this
	project within the next 4 weeks. It is meant to
</p><ul>
	<li>protect all of <i>you</i> from throwing more money at me than I can
	reasonably convert into progress, and to</li>
	<li>ensure that at any point, I will be at most 4 weeks behind any
	commissioned pushes. Therefore, it will also protects <i>me</i> from
	burning out.</li>
</ul>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "cap-too-low"}}
	With the current rate of progress, and the cap being at the low level that
	it is, the project is never going to finish!
</h3>
<p>
	Good news, <a href="/blog/2019-10-14">as of 2019-10-14</a>, progress seems
	to be speeding up now!
</p><p>
	Aside from that, we'll just have to wait until I have more free time, I'm
	afraid.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "slow-2018"}}
	Some of the 2018 pushes were delivered months or even years after they were
	paid‚Ä¶
</h3>
<p>
	Back then, I not only didn't have a cap, but also vastly undersold myself,
	while also offering crowdfunded features for thcrap in parallel. That's
	why the latter are sometimes referred to in the old blog posts here. But
	compare that to now:
</p><ul>
	<li>I've resigned from thcrap</li>
	<li>The aforementioned cap is in place</li>
	<li>The build system for this project is now pretty close to optimal,
	providing quick turnaround times, minimizing frustration, and keeping me
	nicely focused.</li>
</ul><p>
	However, if you <i>absolutely request</i> me to prioritize an element of a
	game that requires a ton of not yet reverse-engineered knowledge to fully
	grasp, and you <i>absolutely</i> don't accept your money going to anything
	else, I <i>will</i> have to put that on the back burner. It will be made
	clear in the backlog whenever that happens, though.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "policenauts"}}
	I'd like to see PC-98 Policenauts (or any other DOS program compiled using
	Borland/Turbo C++) decompiled. What's in it for me?
</h3>
<p>
	The ReC98 repository includes
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/ReC98/blob/master/Research/Borland%20C%2B%2B%20decompilation.md">
	a currently incomplete file with the ASM‚ÜíC++ patterns, as well as
	information about the limits of decompilability</a>. This file will be
	continuously updated with new insights. So while you probably wouldn't
	want to support this project until the very end, it might be worth
	supporting ReC98 for just a bit ‚Äì at least until it becomes obvious that I
	completely figured out Turbo C++, and that other decompilation project
	you wanted to see made significant progress.
</p><p>
	And who knows, maybe we <i>will</i> see a somewhat automated decompilation
	solution come out of this.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "replays"}}
	I want replays! What's in it for me?
</h3>
<p>
	Make sure you know someone willing to implement it. Then, tell me that
	replays are your goal when placing your order, and I'll keep you updated
	once it's trivial to implement and you can stop supporting the project.
	Shouldn't take all too long.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "translations"}}
	I want translations into languages with non-ASCII characters! What's in it
	for me?
</h3>
<p>
	Unless you found someone who's <i>really</i> willing to dig deep into
	PC-98 hardware details, you'd probably want to support, or wait for, the
	entire completed decompilation of your game of choice, since you'd
	probably first want a port to a modern system that supports Unicode and
	fonts.
</p><p>
	Or, y'know, you can just always replace the font ROM of your PC-98
	emulator of choice, because who cares about real hardware anyway, right?
	In that case, it will take considerably less time. Still, make sure to
	tell me that translations are your goal when placing your order.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "netplay"}}
	I want TH03 netplay! What's in it for me?
</h3>
<p>
	I'm not a low-level networking person, so who knows whether doing this
	natively on PC-98 is actually as impractical as it sounds. Porting the
	game to a modern OS with a network stack first (which, again, requires a
	complete decompilation) will certainly be a lot more convenient to whoever
	ends up trying their hand on it, though.
</p>
{{template "</q>"}}



{{template "<q>" "ads"}}
	Do you sell ad space on this site?
</h3>
<p>
	Every contributor, no matter how much they paid, has the option to have
	their name be turned into a link to a URL of their choice. So if you
	consider that to be advertising, then yes. If you had more than that in
	mind, hit me up, and we might make it happen. No JavaScript or remote
	content, though!
</p>
