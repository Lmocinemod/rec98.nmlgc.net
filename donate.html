<h2>Donate</h2>
<p>Can't wait until the store reopens, but want to give me money anyway while expecting nothing in return? You can, under these terms:</p>
<form action="https://www.paypal.com/donate" method="post" target="_top">
	<input type="hidden" name="hosted_button_id" value="XEFRYG66SRFDW" />
	<input type="checkbox" id="consent" required>
	<label for="consent">I agree that
	<ul>
		<li>this donation will be anonymous, and hidden from the public.</li>
		<li>no work will be done in response to this donation, and there is no option to specify a priority for further development. Any requests relating to this transaction that I might communicate on other channels will be ignored.</li>
		<li>the overall frequency of donations like these will influence how quickly regular prices (currently: {{HTML_PushPrice}} per push) will rise for everyone else.</li>
		<li>transactions are processed through PayPal, and clicking the button will direct me to the <code>paypal.com</code> checkout flow.</li>
	</ul></label>

</form>
