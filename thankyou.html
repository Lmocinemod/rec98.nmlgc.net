	I will check your order as soon as I see it, manually enter it into the
	<a href="https://github.com/nmlgc/rec98.nmlgc.net/blob/master/db/transactions.tsv">
	transaction database</a>, and then confirm it via email. After that, the
	newly added <span class="incoming">red part</span> of the goal bar will
	become <span class="confirmed">green</span>.
